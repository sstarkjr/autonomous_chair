3,2023-10-16T22:31:09Z,16-Oct,"Good warranty, uncomfortable chair","I have had the ErgoChair Pro for about a year and a half now, and I am unfortunately disappointed with the chair overall. I can tell than some of the components are high quality, but due to my long-term experience and dissatisfaction with it I would not recommend the chair to any of my friends and family. Two primary reasons:

1: Issues with primary parts and pieces
To be clear, these were all covered under warranty. The warranty is two years, which is good. I was able to talk to someone over chat on their website, and it was relatively painless.

However, the components that were failing were the gas lift cylinder and the back recliner device. The prior simply loses pressure and did so after about 14 months – Not unheard but for a ~$600 chair, not ideal. Again, it was covered under warranty, but still a hassle that I must personally take the chair apart to replace to essential pieces.  

The latter issue is that screws keep popping out of the reclining device. It seems they just weren’t made correctly, and they don’t get proper contact when tightened. They started falling out a few months into use and the recliner has not worked properly since.

2: Seat is like concrete – Very uncomfortable

This could just a preference thing, but the seat of my chair is very uncomfortable. I got the ErchoChair Pro as opposed to ErgoChair Plus because of the “cushion” it supposedly came with. 

However, there is virtually no cushion – It is very firm. I brought this to the attention of customer service, for which they said it is not under warranty and nothing they could do. Fair enough.

That being said, I was referred to this company by a friend who had an Autonomous chair, and their seat is very comfortable and soft. Contrasting my experience greatly. It was brought to my attention by this customer service representative that the cushion could vary depending on when the chair was purchased. I suppose that’s my fault I tried out my friend’s chair, which was very comfortable, ordered my own, and they changed their standards since… 

Overall, this has left me satisfied with practicalities of the customer service and warranty, but dissatisfied with comfort of the chair. I wish something could be done about the uncomfortable cushion despite it not being replaceable by warranty.

3,2021-03-18T10:08:03Z,18-Mar,Not as good as I had hoped.,"Let's address the positives first. This is an absolutely gorgeous chair, it's well built, with a grade of premium plastics that I've never seen before. Both its finish and construction seem very, very good. It is also very adjustable, just as advertised - though there are shortcomings to that adjustability, as we'll get to in a minute. The mesh back is great, the seat cushion is comfortable yet firm enough to offer proper support, and I quite like the firm rubber on top of the armrests. The Evergreen colour is a beautiful apple green that goes exceptionally well with the near-white and grey colors of the rest of the chair.

However, for me there are also several drawbacks to this chair, and over the roughly two weeks I have had it I have struggled to adjust it to my body and work position, which has led to some (hopefully temporary, as I figure things out) back and arm pain. I was expecting to need to adjust to a more active seating position and unlearn some bad habits, but this has been significantly more difficult than expected.

The biggest and most baffling annoyance is the armrests. Most importantly, they are spaced so far apart that my elbows are forced significantly out from my sides - a big no-no if one wants to avoid ulnar deviation when typing. I really wasn't expecting to need a split keyboard along with my chair. I had read the specs, and knew the armrests were spaced out further than on my previous chair, but I was not prepared for just how much. As I'm typing this, my elbows are resting on the inner edge of the rear of the armrests, which is ... passable. I understand the need to cater for wider body types than mine, but these armrests are simply spaced too wide to afford comfortable and well supported typing on any ordinarily sized keyboard. Most ergonomic seating guides advise keeping your elbows close to the torso, which these arm rests do not allow for if you have a moderately slim build. I would go so far as to say these armrests could only suit people with very wide shoulders.

A second flaw is the height of the chair. I am about 183cm or 6ft tall - slightly above average for Sweden, but nothing extraordinary. Yet the chair was simply not tall enough for me to sit in as it arrived. After exchanging the casters for rollerblade-style wheels (which stand 3-4cm taller than the stock casters) it is now good at its tallest setting, but the adjustment range of the hydraulic piston used (about 5cm) is downright disappointing. It's a good thing these are cheap and relatively easy to replace, but this really shouldn't be necessary on a €400 chair. Also, somehow I still have to use the armrests at their lowest setting? The proportions of this design seem quite odd in some respects.

Adjusting the back to a comfortable level of support is also challenging, but doable. I really wish the chair came with a more comprehensive guide to its adjustments. With how the various adjustments relate to each other (for example lumbar support height, back angle, seat depth and seat angle all affect lower back posture and support) it would be very helpful if some guidance was provided.

I'll figure out the back issues in time, so that doesn't worry me, and the height is fine with the new casters, but unless a first party fix is made available I will need to modify the armrests to bring them closer to my body. And that really shouldn't be necessary.",3,0,TRUE,FALSE,"Not as good as I had hoped.: Let's address the positives first. This is an absolutely gorgeous chair, it's well built, with a grade of premium plastics that I've never seen before. Both its finish and construction seem very, very good. It is also very adjustable, just as advertised - though there are shortcomings to that adjustability, as we'll get to in a minute. The mesh back is great, the seat cushion is comfortable yet firm enough to offer proper support, and I quite like the firm rubber on top of the armrests. The Evergreen colour is a beautiful apple green that goes exceptionally well with the near-white and grey colors of the rest of the chair.

However, for me there are also several drawbacks to this chair, and over the roughly two weeks I have had it I have struggled to adjust it to my body and work position, which has led to some (hopefully temporary, as I figure things out) back and arm pain. I was expecting to need to adjust to a more active seating position and unlearn some bad habits, but this has been significantly more difficult than expected.

The biggest and most baffling annoyance is the armrests. Most importantly, they are spaced so far apart that my elbows are forced significantly out from my sides - a big no-no if one wants to avoid ulnar deviation when typing. I really wasn't expecting to need a split keyboard along with my chair. I had read the specs, and knew the armrests were spaced out further than on my previous chair, but I was not prepared for just how much. As I'm typing this, my elbows are resting on the inner edge of the rear of the armrests, which is ... passable. I understand the need to cater for wider body types than mine, but these armrests are simply spaced too wide to afford comfortable and well supported typing on any ordinarily sized keyboard. Most ergonomic seating guides advise keeping your elbows close to the torso, which these arm rests do not allow for if you have a moderately slim build. I would go so far as to say these armrests could only suit people with very wide shoulders.

A second flaw is the height of the chair. I am about 183cm or 6ft tall - slightly above average for Sweden, but nothing extraordinary. Yet the chair was simply not tall enough for me to sit in as it arrived.

1) The seat base can only rise to a maximum of 20 inches. Not ideal if you have long legs. An additional 2 to 3 inches would have much better. Please consider making this an option for those who need it.

2) The armrest can be adjusted back and forth, inward and outward.. This is great. However, you cannot lock it in place. You can only lock in place the height. This results in you having to readjust the position back and forth and inward and outward all the time.

I have noticed just after a few weeks of use that there is a slight wiggle in the tilt of the chair and also side to side.

3,2021-02-16T16:58:55Z,16-Feb,It's Alright,"I've been sitting in a Herman Miller Aeron chair for the past 4 years at my old office. Going to WFH status, I had to buy my own chair and couldn't afford a HM Aeron on my own. Broke life yay! After LOTS of research I decided on the ErgoChair Pro.

Pros:
- Decent level of adjustments for headrest, arms and seat.
- Looks nice
- Wheels are smooth
- Good quality for price point

Cons: 
- Armrests are very jiggly. They move side to side and don't lock in place well. I also wish the arm rests adjusted to an even lower height, for when I push in my chair. (Don't want to adjust my seat height every time I get in and out just to slide it under my desk.)
- Headrest doesn't lock well at the tilt adjustment. Always changing tilt angle on its own.
- Dog owners beware! The seat is a mesh material that traps dog hair. I hadn't originally considered this when purchasing (like an idiot). Now my black mesh seat is constantly covered in hair. WFH problems with the puppers that shed! If your dog doesn't shed, you're good :)  Wish there was a leather version, or a version with the seat being the same mesh material as the back of the chair (i.e. like the HM Aeron) rather than being part of a foam cushion.
- Foam seat is okay. Not as comfortable as I'd imagined. However I don't typically prefer foam seats in general, but that's just a preference. I figured I'd try this chair out anyway due to the great reviews even though I typically don't find foam seats comfortable or great on my back.
- Seat height adjustment is a bit strange. It's on a lever next to another adjustment and is a bit hard reach to adjust. I'd have liked the seat height to be an independent lever.

Overall:
It was a cost effective purchase. I decided not to return it as I felt it still does the job for the price. However the reviews were so good I had extremely high expectations.

From the reviews I read on the web I was expecting months and it was delivered in days. Less than a week.

Assembling was fairly easy and clear. The chair can be adjusted in many ways and this is the key for a comfortable ergonomic chair.

When you lock the reclining seat in place, it bounces back an inch or so. You quickly learn to make do with this.

3,2021-02-10T13:39:17Z,10-Feb,"Great ergonomic chair for the price, but has room for improvement","Let me start by saying for the price point, I think this is a great ergonomic office chair.  It also has a clean aesthetic, and doesn't take up too much room.  All nice things.  

That said, 6 months or so into using this chair (I purchased around the start of the pandemic to fill out my home office space) I have some gripes.  I'll start with those:

NEGATIVES:
-The seat cushion.  The seat cushion isn't very comfortable.  The cushion itself gradually spreads the foam to the edges of the seat and stays there, making it permanently stiff, and doesn't provide a great experience for sitting for long periods of time.  When I first purchased, this wasn't a problem, but it has gradually become more and more annoying.  That said, most office chairs suffer from some form of this, and there isn't a perfect fix.   I would hope that in the future Autonomous will use a more durable stitching over the seat, more resilient and thicker padding for the cushion.  This is the type of attention to detail I would hope for from a ~$400 chair that prides itself on it's comfort and ergonomics. 

-The seat itself.  The seat has some great adjustment features, allowing you to expand it in and out from the back of the chair, giving you a larger or smaller surface area for sitting, and it can tilt a good bit, allowing you to make it sit at more of an acute or obtuse angle with the backrest, depending on your preference.  That said, I believe the tilt adjustment is what has caused the issue I'm about to describe.   Once you lock the seat into a newly adjusted position, it's never fully locked.  It won't slip out of it's position per se, but it won't remain entirely immobile either, it has a few degrees of play that allow it to shift up and down as you move around in your chair and shift your sitting position.  This makes for a less stable and ergonomic sitting experience, and it makes the seat feel a bit cheap, as it makes the seat feel wobbly instead of secure.

-The hand/arm rests.  The fact that these are adjustable, both from a height and length perspective is nice.  That said, you aren't able to lock the rests into a length/angle position.  They continually shift around and squeak.   It doesn't break the functionality of the chair, but it comes off as a cheap solution, and contributes to the overall feel that the chair isn't as sturdy as it could be. 

POSITIVES:
-The price is competitive
-The delivery and assembly is quick and easy 
-The colorways are pleasing and sensible
-The back rest is comfortable and so far the webbing has been durable and held its integrity.  
-The free/locked angle adjustments you can make with the backrest, along with adjusting the tension for when it is in the free state are all great features that I believe serve their purpose well. 
-The headrest does its job. 
-My cat hasn't been able to destroy it yet.
-It's a great starting point to the world of ergonomic chairs so you can understand how you will mostly use it, and what your comfort preferences are. 

I don't have a picture on hand right now, but I can upload one later.   I have also have the autonomous DIY standing desk kit, and added my own slab of wood on top, and am very happy with the results there.  No complaints there as of yet.  

All in all I would recommend these 2 Autonomous products, because I have not found a better cost-effective solution out there at this time.",3,0,TRUE,FALSE,"Great ergonomic chair for the price, but has room for improvement: Let me start by saying for the price point, I think this is a great ergonomic office chair.  It also has a clean aesthetic, and doesn't take up too much room.  All nice things.  

That said, 6 months or so into using this chair (I purchased around the start of the pandemic to fill out my home office space) I have some gripes.  I'll start with those:

NEGATIVES:
-The seat cushion.  The seat cushion isn't very comfortable.  The cushion itself gradually spreads the foam to the edges of the seat and stays there, making it permanently stiff, and doesn't provide a great experience for sitting for long periods of time.  When I first purchased, this wasn't a problem, but it has gradually become more and more annoying.  That said, most office chairs suffer from some form of this, and there isn't a perfect fix.   I would hope that in the future Autonomous will use a more durable stitching over the seat, more resilient and thicker padding for the cushion.  This is the type of attention to detail I would hope for from a ~$400 chair that prides itself on it's comfort and ergonomics. 

-The seat itself.  The seat has some great adjustment features, allowing you to expand it in and out from the back of the chair, giving you a larger or smaller surface area for sitting, and it can tilt a good bit, allowing you to make it sit at more of an acute or obtuse angle with the backrest, depending on your preference.  That said, I believe the tilt adjustment is what has caused the issue I'm about to describe.   Once you lock the seat into a newly adjusted position, it's never fully locked.  It won't slip out of it's position per se, but it won't remain entirely immobile either, it has a few degrees of play that allow it to shift up and down as you move around in your chair and shift your sitting position.  This makes for a less stable and ergonomic sitting experience, and it makes the seat feel a bit cheap, as it makes the seat feel wobbly instead of secure.

-The hand/arm rests.  The fact that these are adjustable, both from a height and length perspective is nice.  That said, you aren't able to lock the rests into a length/angle position.  They continually shift around and squeak.   It doesn't break the functionality of the chair, but it comes off as a cheap solution, and contributes to the overall feel that the chair isn't as sturdy as it could be. 

POSITIVES:
-The price is competitive
-The delivery and assembly is quick and easy 
-The colorways are pleasing and sensible
-The back rest is comfortable and so far the webbing has been durable and held its integrity.  
-The free/locked angle adjustments you can make with the backrest, along with adjusting the tension for when it is in the free state are all great features that I believe serve their purpose well. 
-The headrest does its job. 
-My cat hasn't been able to destroy it yet.
-It's a great starting point to the world of ergonomic chairs so you can understand how you will mostly use it, and what your comfort preferences are.

Only think that bugs me for the price of this chair is the wobble of the seat platform on the base, as well as the give on the back support when it's in a locked position (giving about an inch or so), just doesn't fee as premium as  it should for the price.

The one thing that is kind of disappointing to me is the lack of padding in the seat. The seat feels pretty hard for me and it was the main reason I wanted a new chair so I am still finding myself sitting on a pillow. The other reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the hardware to put it together. There are 4 screws with a washer and a compression ring used to attach all the levers to the bottom of the seat. The two rear screws needed to be a bit longer. I emailed the company and they told me it would take a week to get a new set of hardware sent to me for the chair. When I finally received the hardware it was hardware for something completely different. I am going to assume it was for one of their desks as the hardware contained wood screws. So after waiting another week to use my chair I ended up just not using the compressor washers for the 2 back screws.

There are so many adjustments that I was so excited to find a chair that I could match to my liking. But the problem is that the lumber support is much does not adjust and feels like a fist in your back. It adjusts up and down which is good but it does not adjust front to back.

Overall: Worth the price, but still slightly below my expectations, I couldn't call it anything more than ""average"" for this price range. It's a nice, comfortable, ergonomic chair that seems like it has good quality, but the texture of the materials feels a little cheap and some things could use some improvements. The Good: 1.The chair is without question very comfortable, much more so than my old chair. 2.I love the switch that makes the back of the chair push forward, I tend to lean forward a lot when at the computer, which I know is really bad for posture, and this will definitely help. If that setting is on it is actually more comfortable to sit upright than it is to hunch over! 3. Looks great, overall just a cool looking chair 4. Lots of adjustable stuff! 5. Decently heavy so it doesn't end up rolling around accidentally The Bad: 1. It feels cheap, Autonomous did a pretty good job making it look nicer than it is, I was under the impression the majority of this chair was metal, that is definitely not the case. From a distance it looks metal, but in reality almost everything is plastic with the exceptions of the mechanisms under the seat. It's nice and heavy, so I know it is solid. It seems durable and I'm not worried about it breaking, but but I wish they picked a different texture on almost everything other than the backrest and the cushion. 2. A lot of the adjustable stuff doesn't adjust as easily as it should or adjusts too easily. the neck rest is probably my biggest complaint on the whole chair, there's no button to lock its up/down motions and even a little bit of downward pressure will cause it to slide all the way down to the bottom. On the opposite end of the spectrum is rotating the headrest. There is also no button for this and it takes so much force to rotate it that I worry I'm going to break it, then when it finally moves there is a click so loud that the first time I did it I was sure something had broken. Even with both these things the worst part is that when you are sitting straight up and down the neck rest is still a good distance from your neck, its really only useful if you're lounging back. I was really excited to have a chair with neck support but even with the setting on where the back of the chair leans forward the neck rest still doesn't make contact with my neck. 3. I wish I could lower the chair just a tiny bit more, the lowest setting just seems a little too tall to me, but that could be the fact my old one was if anything too low",3,0,TRUE,FALSE,": Just got mine in the mail today and my first impressions are mixed.

If that setting is on it is actually more comfortable to sit upright than it is to hunch over! 3. Looks great, overall just a cool looking chair 4. Lots of adjustable stuff! 5. Decently heavy so it doesn't end up rolling around accidentally The Bad: 1. It feels cheap, Autonomous did a pretty good job making it look nicer than it is, I was under the impression the majority of this chair was metal, that is definitely not the case. From a distance it looks metal, but in reality almost everything is plastic with the exceptions of the mechanisms under the seat. It's nice and heavy, so I know it is solid. It seems durable and I'm not worried about it breaking, but but I wish they picked a different texture on almost everything other than the backrest and the cushion. 2. A lot of the adjustable stuff doesn't adjust as easily as it should or adjusts too easily. the neck rest is probably my biggest complaint on the whole chair, there's no button to lock its up/down motions and even a little bit of downward pressure will cause it to slide all the way down to the bottom. On the opposite end of the spectrum is rotating the headrest. There is also no button for this and it takes so much force to rotate it that I worry I'm going to break it, then when it finally moves there is a click so loud that the first time I did it I was sure something had broken. Even with both these things the worst part is that when you are sitting straight up and down the neck rest is still a good distance from your neck, its really only useful if you're lounging back. I was really excited to have a chair with neck support but even with the setting on where the back of the chair leans forward the neck rest still doesn't make contact with my neck. 3. I wish I could lower the chair just a tiny bit more, the lowest setting just seems a little too tall to me, but that could be the fact my old one was if anything too low"

- Some components could have been made more sturdier for this price range.
Overall, the chair is good. This is my first ergonomic chair so I don't have anything to compare it with. I've been using SecretLab gaming chair which has some ergonomic components, but is quite different in how it's made. 
I'll continue using the chair and we'll see over time."

As a result, I don't slouch or sit in bad positions. Also, the punctured material is really cool because it ""breaths,"" so you don't sweat. Lastly, it's highly customizable. It has lots of handles which enable you to try different positions. It's a big plus because you don't get stiff sitting in the same position.
- What could be improved: One of the things that I think could be improved is the seat. It feels like you're slipping from it, no matter how I fix it. Maybe it's just me, though.

I would preface this to say I'm a bit on the shorter side, so certain aspects of the chair may not be applicable to my experience (seat depth, armrest height, etc). The chair itself is very comfortable, has various points of adjustment and articulation, and is overall a great purchase for someone who works from home. My biggest issue with the chair itself is how CREAKY it gets. I'm about 150lb so I don't think I'm putting the chair to the test weight-wise, but everything from leaning back to scooting the chair makes some pretty loud noises. It may be due to my desk being set on a rug, so traction could be a factor (notably does roll quietly on hardwood, so I'll have to get a chair mat), but I definitely think there's room for improvement as my rug has a very low pile.
Another potential issue is the surface area that collects dust! While the additional lower back support is really helpful, that little cushion collects dust like it's nobody's business, as well as the many support structures on the back. It's easily fixed as I have a small desk vacuum, so it's not too bad.

* The chair smells pretty bad when it arrived and it took a few days for the smell to evaporate. If you can, I would suggest letting it air out for a while.

4,2023-10-28T00:41:26Z,28-Oct,"Great chair, but its not flawless","What I like:
- Very comfortable, which in my opinion is the most important thing about a chair.
- Allows you to set a maximum angle for how far it should recline
- Lumbar support is comfortable and fits snuggly against your back
- feels fairly durable - guess only time will tell how long that lasts, but no issues with creaking or bending with the plastic construction. Sturdy


What I dislike:
- Instructions were unclear and pictured in a strange perspective. Step 4 for example, you have to infer what side is the front of the chair from the image. Also the instructions for the adjustments are from the perspective of someone watching you in the chair rather than you sitting in the chair doing it, so you have to do that mental flip in your head to understand where everything is.
- Not everything is fully adujstible from a sitting position, which is an issue and a nonissue as a lot of the adjustments are a do once and forget about it kind of thing, but it would be nice if the lumbar support and head rest adjustment was more accessible while sitting down.
- I wish the armrests locked in place like the back of the chair does. As you get into the chair, you might grab an arm as you sit down, causing it to move so that you to have to adjust it again

What else you should know:
- If you have a curious cat, the mesh back might be a prime target for their claws
- Has this pretty gross fresh-out-the-factory plasticy smell for the first day or two
- The box this comes in is absolutely monsterious. 67lbs, with the chair being 64lbs. If you assemble the chair and are on the fence about returning it, you now have this huge box to store in your home in the meantime.

Comfortable for many hours.
Helps me sit up straight - my posture is improved (I'm doing other things for that, too, but I spend a LOT of time working in this chair).

It doesn't lean forward far enough - I don't feel straight upright - always slightly leaned back.

Autonomous was very easy to deal with and sent me a new set of armrests (only the foam topper was really needed). All else equal, I would buy again. If only I could resolve my armrest issue."

Since I'm WFH now, I needed to invest in a really good chair. The previous two chairs I had (first was a hand-me-down executive chair and the second was more of a cheaper task chair) had pros and cons but ultimately I was experiencing too much back pain. I wanted to enjoy sitting at my desk.

My friend has the ErgoChair, so he recommended it to me. I was somewhat skeptical because I did all the measurements and figured out I'd need to have every adjustment basically maxed out in order to sit ergonomically. But reading the reviews of other large people was encouraging. I bit the bullet and ordered it.

It got here WAY faster than I thought it would (I ordered on a Monday afternoon and it came in on Thursday morning of that same week). Wasn't too hard to put together thanks to the setup video. 

It took me a little bit to figure out what adjustments to use and how I wanted to sit, but I have my general settings pretty set now. It's not perfect by any means. The headrest isn't really suited for tall people like me, but it doesn't get in the way for me like I've seen it for others in their reviews. The back support is phenomenal, which is the biggest plus, and exactly what I was looking for. The seat is juuuuuust long enough for me at the forward most setting (the picture shows me sitting all the way back in the chair at the most forward setting). I'd prefer it to be a little bit bigger so my legs don't hang over as much, which was the biggest problem with my last chair. 

I'd say the only thing I dislike about this chair is the armrests. The height and height adjustments are perfectly fine, it's the left to right and back to front adjustments that are annoying since its not controlled by a switch, so I can't really set one position and keep it that way. Also the material and shape of the armrests... I'm not really sure what they were going for. It's a hard surface so sometimes my elbows will hurt, and even if I find a good position with them, it still doesn't feel 100% natural.

- Great value for the money
- Very comfortable, love the mesh
- Ergonomic, feels good in the back
- Good quality, feels sturdy
- Great design, it looks realy nice

Cons
- Neck rest feels good but the adjustment is horrible. If you lean on it it drops down for example
- Lumbar support is great but super hard to adjust
- Armrests feels great but the adjustment is weird. It has no lock so it moves with any movement
- The seat pivots when you move which is a bit annoying and it makes it feel a bit less sturdy. I usually don't tilt to much it doesn't happen very often. I tried fixing this and I learned that it's because of the seat adjustemt (you can push the seat back and forth) which have two screws that need to sit loosely. Because of the sitting loosely the chair can pivot.

I would definitely recommend this chair. Remember that chairs of the same quality is easily $500-$1000+",4,0,TRUE,FALSE,"Love the chair but it's not perfect: Pros:

4,2021-04-12T20:05:21Z,12-Apr,Overall great chair,"The ErgoChair Pro is overall a great chair though not perfect, especially straight out of the box. The cushion has been very comfortable so far (for reference, I am 150lbs). I appreciate the many degrees of freedom for adjusting the chair, though I don't find myself making any adjustments often. Despite being mostly plastic construction it feels solid and looks great. And it's dead silent. So as with many things, the things this chair does well go unnoticed. On the other hand, the downsides are rather glaring, but luckily they were addressable. The first thing is the wheels that come with chair; I had heard they were low quality plastic and it definitely seemed that way when they arrived. I bought myself some rubber rollerblade-style wheels on Amazon ahead of time and didn't even bother putting on the included ones. I also found that the armrests got in the way, and unfortunately they can't be folded out of the way, so I left them off. Finally, the most annoying part of the chair (personally) was the lumbar support, which felt like it was pressing against my back too much wherever I moved it. I was able to use some of my own hex keys to dismantle the mesh back of the chair from the back support and then undo the joint holding the mesh taut. From there I could remove hold a screw holding the cushion in place and pull the whole thing out. So luckily I was able to resolve a lot of the issues I faced (maybe this will help someone else too).

Decided to try out the ErgoChair Pro after a couple of days of research. Overall I'd say for the price you get a lot of adjustments that you don't find on most chairs. If you are deciding I'd recommend checking out the ErgoChair Pro adjustments video on YouTube since it was one of the main reasons I bought the chair.

I'm 6'3 and have a slender long build so most chairs seats dont support my legs, the best thing for this chair was I can change the seat depth (which is hard to find) to make it more comfortable.

Some cons are there is a break-in period to get used to the chair, and right off the bat you might not know how to adjust it to your liking. After a couple weeks when you get used to adjusting the chair for long sitting sessions is when the purchase pays off. Another con is the arm rests are hard so I put memory foam cushions on them for like $20, personally i use arm rest cushions on all my office chairs so it might not affect you.

My only critique is the arm rests. I love that they move around a bit with your arms and the adjustments are very good.

I've got a few *minor* complaints:
1). The chair sits on a pneumatic cylinder to raise and lower. Unfortunately it doesn't screw in or anything it just sits on top. This causes a slight wobble in the chair as I sit in it.

4). The Lumbar adjustment  doesn't go up and down smoothly, it's kinda in a weird angled gimble that allows you some degree of control over how forward backward it is but I have a long torso and really need it moved up a couple inches.

The only one of those issues that's really a problem is the lumbar adjustment. It's not bad enough that I would go through the headache of a mail order return, but if I could've sat in it before I purchased it I may've opted to find a chair with a more adjustable lumbar support."

Prior to my ErgoChair, I was using a DX Racer Gaming chair for roughly 4-5 years. I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed the chair and made great use of it over the course of its lifespan (I still keep it as a secondary) but recognized in the latter half of its tenure - just how bad it was for ergonomics and posture, etc. 

I was doing my due diligence this holiday season to research a new chair/investment. As I am someone who works from home (like many of us this year) I thought it would be wise to ensure my new chair would address some glaring issues and 'future-proof' my health concerns. I'll start by saying that my ErgoChair is (for the most part) incredibly comfortable. The mesh back is a pleasant upgrade from fabric. It's breathable, flexible, and feels comforting for long hours of use. The headrest (although I find myself often forgetting I have one) is a nice bonus. The plethora of functionalities that the ErgoChair provides is probably the major selling point for me. There is a ton of customization when it comes to tilt, pan, seat, arms, lumbar, headrest, etc. It's aesthetically beautiful and really separates itself from other chairs in this respect, in my opinion.

The two biggest flaws that I am quite disappointed about (considering the cost and echelon this chair proclaims to be in) are the comfortability of the seat, specifically. I am someone who (as previously mentioned) works from home and I find myself in my chair for 12-14 hours a day on weekdays. The cushioning the seat provides is subpar at best and I've heard worse from people with larger frames than mine (for reference - I'm 5'10 and 160 pounds). I'm very likely to be looking into purchasing a seat cushion of some sort to help this. The second issue I have is the arms. They SQUEAK - and I mean SQUEAK! In spite of the fact they have a wide range of function/motion - every time I tinker with them, they squeak and (if I'm being thoroughly honest) feel rather cheap for a chair in a price range like this. Not much can be done about this, but something that I'm sure all owners of the product will note.

Aside from those two issues, I'm quite happy with the chair. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to try 'upgrading' from a generic office/task chair, gaming chair, etc. The price tag is indeed steep, but feels (for the most part) justifiable, especially with holiday price incentives and discounts, etc. You can always try it for 30 days and make your decision at the end of that trial period.

4,2020-12-28T15:26:16Z,28-Dec,ErgoChair2,"I've always has poor posture sitting in an office chair. I'm an oilfield consultant and I spend 8 to 12 hours (sometimes more) in front of screens / desk. 

I broke my neck back in August 2020, with 3 severely fracture vertebrates (C6, C7 and T1).

After 11 screws and 2 titanium rods, in my spine, I HAD to get an GOOD ""ergonomic chair"" with a head / neck rest, both at my office and my home office. I should add, I'm NOT wheel chair bound and I still have full range of mobility

I've probably got ~10 hours of research, on-line, trying to find the ""PERFECT ergonomic high back office chair"", plus another ~2 or 3 hours of driving around an testing out office chairs in stores.

If found the ErgoChair right aways,,,, and keep comig back to it thru my on-line research.

I will be honest, I just won't pay $1100 - $1500 (or more) for a office chair,,,, especially if I haven't sat in prior, to purhcase.

I would give the ErgoChair Pro, Four Stars.

Pro's:

Price: Great price I thought @ ~$400 for what you getting!
Weight rating: 350lbs --- most ""box store"" office chairs are only good for 250 lbs (I'm 235 lbs).
Shipping: The shipping was fast! In fact, it was AHEAD of schedule!
Mesh back: Feels fine,,,, doesn't pull on clothing or catch my hair.
Foam seat: Bit hard, but I'm still breaking it in,,,, I'm hoping it softens up.
Casters: Feel fine --- could easily replace for ~$30, with those single ""roller blade style"" wheels if desired.
Seat Adjustment:
1) You can slide the seat forward, which I quite like, as I like to lean back, while working (prior to my neck fracture, even more so now).
2) If your tall, this prevents legs from hanging off the edge give full support to the thigh.
3) For some reason, you can tilt the seat forward, sloping dowwards towards your feet. I have NO idea who would want to sit like that, as it not only unconfortable, but just a general weird feeling, as you feel like your sliding out of your seat. But hey,,,, who am I to say,,,, I just don't use the feature, which is why I've left it under the Pro section!
Back adjustment:
1) It lays WAY back,,,, further than a lazy boy recliner chair! Gamers might like this or office workers if you wanted a 10 minute siesta! Otherwise, it lays so far back, I don't know what else you would use it for.
2) There 3 adjustments for the back: 
a) tension / resistance for the back tilt
b) Lock in place for desired back lilt (or fully recline as mentioned above). 
c) Then there is a 3rd adjustmet on the actualy back of the chair which allows for a normal say 5 or 10 degree's of ""motion"" leaning forward or backward in the chair.
Arm Rests:
1) Comforable, mildly concave, neophrene type surface.
2) Good height adjustment
Head Rest: 
This was the #1 reason I bought this chair (without trying it out in store first too, I might add). I was VERY happy with the head rest. The old version of me would have liked it, as it forces you (a bit) to sit ""somewhat normal and not slouch, as much"". The new version of me (broken neck version) LOVES it!
1) Slides up and down, easily, depending on your height.
2) You can tilt it up and down, which really, is more like tilting it either forward a bit or backwards a bit. As when you tilt it up and down, it either retracts or protutrudes a bit.
3) The head rest is comfortable to the back of head.
4) Doesn't pull on your hair (short or long).
5) Doesnt' create any heat, as its a mesh back.
6) I actually find, I adjust the head rest, thru the day, as I change my body position in the chair, thru the day,,,, super easy to do,,, literally 1.5 to 2 seconds to do.


Con's:

Back Tilt: 
1) I wish there was maybe ~5 degree's  more of ""range of motion"" in the chair when leaning forward, or more specifically, backwards.
Foam Seat: 
1) I wish it was more ""plush"" feeling, as I spend a GREAT deal of time at my desk. 
Arm Rests:
1) The arm rests NEED to rotate or toe inwards and outwards (well,,, back to parallel with the seat cushion would be just fine) . I had this feature on my old office chair (c/w no head rest), which I LOVED. Think about it,,,, you sit in your chair and as you reach for and use the keyboard, your arms and hands form a triangle (elbow to fingers, fingers back to the other elbow, then elbow to elbow). These arms rests do NOT rotate inwards, so yes, they DO support the elbow, but that is it... Again, I LOVED that feature on my old chair (no idea on the brand,,,, it certainly wasn't fancy...). I'm fortunate enough, that we have ""adjustable height"" desks in our office, so I could rotate my arm rests inwards, set the desk height, at the PERFECT height and my arms would rest comfortably, all day!
2) The arm rests DO slide forward and backwards, plus what I'm going to call left to right. I find the arm wrests will move / slide a bit, the more used the chair is getting,,,,, but it's certainly not a deal breaker.


All in all, for what you get for ~$400, this is a GREAT CHAIR!

I will give it a 4 out of 5!!

0.5 star gone for NOT having rotating inward arm rests.
0.5 star gone for stiffer seat cushion.


Seems like doable ""tweaks"" for ErgoChair 3!


PS: I always hang my jacket on the back of my chair, when working out of the office. I would be ""nice"" to have an actual plastic formed / shaped, coat hanger, on the back up the chair, right about where the head rest is attached in the back. Something for the wish list!",4,0,TRUE,FALSE,"ErgoChair2: I've always has poor posture sitting in an office chair. I'm an oilfield consultant and I spend 8 to 12 hours (sometimes more) in front of screens / desk. 

I broke my neck back in August 2020, with 3 severely fracture vertebrates (C6, C7 and T1).

After 11 screws and 2 titanium rods, in my spine, I HAD to get an GOOD ""ergonomic chair"" with a head / neck rest, both at my office and my home office. I should add, I'm NOT wheel chair bound and I still have full range of mobility

I've probably got ~10 hours of research, on-line, trying to find the ""PERFECT ergonomic high back office chair"", plus another ~2 or 3 hours of driving around an testing out office chairs in stores.

If found the ErgoChair right aways,,,, and keep comig back to it thru my on-line research.

I will be honest, I just won't pay $1100 - $1500 (or more) for a office chair,,,, especially if I haven't sat in prior, to purhcase.

I would give the ErgoChair Pro, Four Stars.

Pro's:

Price: Great price I thought @ ~$400 for what you getting!
Weight rating: 350lbs --- most ""box store"" office chairs are only good for 250 lbs (I'm 235 lbs).
Shipping: The shipping was fast! In fact, it was AHEAD of schedule!
Mesh back: Feels fine,,,, doesn't pull on clothing or catch my hair.
Foam seat: Bit hard, but I'm still breaking it in,,,, I'm hoping it softens up.
Casters: Feel fine --- could easily replace for ~$30, with those single ""roller blade style"" wheels if desired.
Seat Adjustment:
1) You can slide the seat forward, which I quite like, as I like to lean back, while working (prior to my neck fracture, even more so now).
2) If your tall, this prevents legs from hanging off the edge give full support to the thigh.
3) For some reason, you can tilt the seat forward, sloping dowwards towards your feet. I have NO idea who would want to sit like that, as it not only unconfortable, but just a general weird feeling, as you feel like your sliding out of your seat. But hey,,,, who am I to say,,,, I just don't use the feature, which is why I've left it under the Pro section!

4,2020-12-18T21:25:49Z,18-Dec,High value with lots of adjustment options for ergonomics and comfort,"Just picked one of these up during black friday, since the office gave me a budget for a chair. This is one of the only well-reviewed ergonomic chairs I could find under 500CAD (~350 USD).
Here's is my review after living with it for two weeks:

Assembly: 3.5/5
It was fairly easy to install. The visual assembly manual is a little bit vague at times but not difficult to figure out. Some of the pieces, particularly the wheels, took some forcing to install.

Build quality: 3.5/5
The build is mostly plastic, but quite sturdy; the important parts such as the piston and the primary adjustment mechanisms are made of metal and are clearly robust. Some bits such as the headrest and armrests seem just that little bit less well built than the rest.

Comfort and ergonomics: 4.5/5
There are 12 different ways to adjust this chair (that I've been able to figure out thus far)! It took a little figuring out at first to find what adjustments I mostly keep fixed and which ones I modify regularly to change my position for different postures.
I'm now mostly settled into it. It can both keep me in a comfortable, ergonomic position(s) for work, as well as allow more relaxed and laid back options. I particularly like that the recline has a locking mechanism that does not spring up automatically when unlocked -- it waits until you recline a bit further to unset it and return to neutral position. The lumbar support is a tad clumsy to adjust, but once I found the right position I didn't touch it again. The back tension control and lock are nice, and the head rest is comfortable if you find the right position for whatever geometry you are currently sitting in (very easy to adjust).

I am a short person, coming in at 5'6"", and I do wish that the chair descended just a centimeter further. The multiple seat tilt angles make up for it, but nonetheless it would be nice.
The  armrest adjustments are a bit limited; they don't rotate quite enough or slide closer to the body quite enough; I tend to just push them as far to the sides as possible and not use them while typing. Again though, I'm a small person though so my arm-span and chest aren't very wide. I don't generally use armrests all that much anyway since I type for much of the day. I may end up removing the armrests all together (yes, you can do that!) but we'll see.

Quality of life: 5/5
Coming from my old desk chair, even after two weeks I've noticed most of my small aches and pains from working from home have largely subsided.

Value Sentiment: 5/5

4,2020-11-30T11:50:12Z,30-Nov,"I wanted to hate this chair, but it's hard to..","I wanted to hate this chair JUST because I wanted UPS to have to come up to my steps and grab it because they refused to deliver it up the stairs for me two days in a row resulting in me having to lug it over my shoulder - a 3' x 4' box that weighed 70LBs with a bad back to get it.  I wanted that lazy driver to suffer, but I can't.  I just enjoy this chair WAY too much, so I'll have to devise another way to exact my revenge on his lazy butt.

At 36, and as a Programmer/Graphic Designer/3d Artist/Game Designer I spend WAY too much time at my desk.  More than I'm happy about, to be perfectly honest which equates to a LOT of potential for thoracic pain, tension migraines, pinched nerves, and sharp pains in my coccyx due to the last chair I had having springs in the seat and the padding wearing down.  
Because of all of these issues I've made the jump from ""executive chairs"" into proper ergonomic chairs in the hopes that it'll increase productivity, but also overall physical and emotional health.  Some of you reading this may know, and some may not, but even something as simple as posture correction can alleviate sinus congestion, migraines, frequent joint pains, and increase your mental well-being by a dramatic amount.  Hence my journey to find a proper ergonomic chair.

I've looked into Secretlab's Nueue, Office Depot's WorkPro Quantum 9000, and 12000, Herman Miller's ENTIRE lineup, Steelcase's Leap and Gesture, and EVERY ergonomic chair on amazon, read HUNDREDS of reviews regarding the Ergo Chair 2 and even watched countless videos from BTOD.  I am aware of all the people whining on reddit about this being a ""third-party Chinese chair"" (which it IS - and is the exact same price as the wholesale cost before you go getting the wrong opinion) but what they don't realize is that it's REALLY common in the furniture industry for brands to utilize this method.  It works for the Chinese companies because they get to expand their market, and it helps U.S. companies expand their business, and product line as well.

Ultimately I came to the conclusion that I would try out the Ergo Chair 2 for TWO reasons even though I'd never sat in it:
1.  I know the stipulations of the return very well, and took note to record my unpackaging experience to ensure that IF I decided to return the chair - it'd be right back the same way it came, and I have 30 days to acclimate to the chair and decide whether it's the right fit for me, and my work environment.

2.  With the blog subscription promo code, and the black Friday sale I was able to get the Ergo Chair 2 for $320 after tax, and that's pretty hard to pass up for a chair with this much customization a 2-year warranty, and a 30-day no questions asked return period.

So here's my overall thoughts - as someone that WANTED to hate this chair and company just to spite a lazy prick, and is typing in it right now...

¤  Customer support - I spoke to them prior to the order being shipped out because there was an uninformed delay on getting it out of the warehouse and requested to cancel.  While preparing to cancel the order for me the rep informed me that ""due to Thanksgiving it could take a bit longer to receive the funds back"" to which I said ""oh, I keep forgetting about Thanksgiving, I'll go ahead and wait and see if I like it then"" and the order was continued to be put through.  They're MORE than willing to ensure that you don't have any second thoughts and discuss any concerns you might have over live-chat, so feel free to contact them!

¤  Packaging - The box (which has a second box within it and another box within that containing the casters, and a few other small parts) came SLIGHTLY damaged (which I'll discuss in the cons section) but it was in areas and ways that I could tell it was because of UPS's handling procedures, and NOT a direct result of any mishandling, or recycled packaging.  Everything is wrapped in foam, cardboard, and bubble wrap - LITERALLY - My seat pan, and the seat back had a foam pad on top of it surrounded by bubble wrap, and enclosed in it's own portion of the box.  The packaging is TOP NOTCH!

¤  Assembly - Assembly was fairly straight-forward, and considerably easier than some of the chairs I've had to assemble in the past while working for OfficeMax as a Furniture Dept. Supervisor.  There are a FEW quirks that I hope eventually get ironed out such as the instructions not showing where to screw the headrest bolts into - and the headrest portion not being 100% flat resulting in me having to alternate torque between the two bolts to ensure that I didn't strip the holes, but both of those should fall under ""common-sense"" when building something, so it's not that big of a deal.

Assembling the arm portions was a bit of a nuisance in that you have to flip the seat pan upside down and there's no indicator for left, or right or front and back on the arms which made me have to do it twice, and I didn't figure that out until I'd already built the entire chair, and went to sit in it.  So I had to flip the assembled chair over, and remove both arms, then alternate the location.  A simple sticker could have prevented this from being an issue, and is a large oversight since the design of the chair made taking the arms off REALLY complicated once assembled due to lack of room for the included tool not to catch on the control handles, and ultimately scuff them.

¤  Lumbar - The lumbar (I took mine apart from the chair to see how it functioned - I do NOT recommend doing this without proper tools because it's nearly completely inaccessible, and a pain in the butt to reassemble without proper tools.) protrudes quite a bit, and although it's height adjustable it uses two ball-bearings press-fitted into brass pegs located within two holes on the lumbar that act as the ""retention mechanism"" and they work great for that, but for trying to move it they make it a nightmare.  There is a lever on the back of the seat-back that ""adjusts lumbar tension"" but on my chair specifically (maybe it's mis-manufactured) all it does is allow the chair to recline slightly more, and cause it to curl inward instead of stopping at a 90° upright position resulting in a LOT of pain on the ""reduced tension"" mode while sitting up.  While leaning back it DOES reduce pressure, but I feel like a simple tension knob and a spring would have been WORLDS better (although I do love the recline!)  

¤  Mesh back - It's comfortable, but not at the same time.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but once your skin gets used to it you'll be fine.  The first day it was VERY itchy, and kept irritating my skin, but the 2nd day I brushed it with a soft bristle-brush that I have to remove any dead skin particles, dust, etc. and cleaned up the chair (as I will continue to do every day) and since then it's been fine, so I think that's just some leftover fibers from the manufacturing.  It's strong, rigid, but also has a decent elasticity to it that is comforting.  I'm not a fan of mesh because I know that MOST manufacturers aren't going to take it's mounting seriously and someone's going to fall backward.  I doubt that's going to happen with this chair.  The mesh is more elasto-polymer (stretchy plastic) than ""mesh"" and due to that could easily be melted into the press-fit that holds it in place, and if I had a bet I'd say that's exactly what they've done because I don't see this giving way any time soon.  The breathability is great, and it's odd, but the amount of sound I realized I was never hearing from behind me until now is disturbing.  Solid-back chairs RUIN sound stage for studio sound setups.

¤  The seat - The seat is a point of contention for a number of buyers of any chair, and there are many reasons, but I'll stick with the ones people tend to rate this chair lowly - It bottoms out easily.  I spoke to customer support during my ""I think I want to cancel"" idiocy, and the lady I spoke with said that she hasn't had that problem personally, and initially I thought she was just doing her ""I'm going to try to make sure we get the sale"" tactic - until I sat in the seat a little longer and realized ...
It's REALLY hard to tell that it's bottoming out.  I weigh 170LB's and am ""average build"" in every way possible, and although I DO bottom out the seat the cushion still supports me and I feel it underneath me in a way that is really confusing until you get used to it.  I don't feel any tension in my legs, or loss of circulation, etc. and I suffer from ""no ass at all"" so it's EASY for me to get uncomfortable in a chair, and I've been in this one for 4 hours already today before writing this review, and it's fine.  I've tested sitting cross-legged, and crossing each individual foot underneath the opposite leg, and the seat does great at providing enough padding for this sitting style even IF it's not ergonomically advisable.

¤  The arms - These are the only part of the chair that I legitimately can NOT stand.  The 'mechanism' for the side, and front to back movement is probably the laziest design I've ever seen a company take.  They formed channels for the arm to move, and assemble it in a way to where it just allows you to move them left/right, forward/backward.  There's no lock, and because it's all done in plastic it does squeak that VERY annoying squeak that plastic grinding plastic gives you.  The up/down mechanism locks, but it's only in increments, and not exactly where you need it to be, so you either have to sacrifice arm-height, desk height, or chair height in order to get it perfectly level with your desk's surface area like it's supposed to be.  I've found that my arms don't move as ""freely"" side to side, or forward and back as some people have said they do, but I'm sure over time that they will just because of their design.

The ""padding"" on the arms IS a pad, it's a polyurethane foam that's VERY stiff, firm, yet SLIGHTLY malleable.  The arms have a concave indention about half a mm deep that makes ZERO sense, and the edges are sharp resulting in pretty large overall discomfort if you can't get them to angle the way you want them to.

I've also found that due to manufacturing tolerances not being properly dialed in my left arm doesn't move in nearly as far as my right on the forward inner-angle adjustment.  I did notice that the arm pads screw on, so I'm going to be looking into either manufacturing my own, or buying some aftermarket ones if I can that are actually rounded, and more ergonomically friendly because these are NOT.  They're not uncomfortable unless you lean to one side of the other, or are prone to having your face rest on your arm, etc.
The physical arm ""stems"" don't have the commonly associated task chair ""wobble"" so that's nice.  They are nestled pretty securely in their housing.  There is a small amount of play, but overall it's FAR more pleasant than ""task chairs"" that I've tried int he past.

¤  The headrest - It's comfortable, and I've found that at 5'11"" it does fit me VERY easily, but taller people may have trouble with it as I have to nearly bring it to max height to support the bottom of my cranium.  It uses the same ball-bearing lock system that the lumbar does, so it takes a fair bit of effort to move, and even though it's mounted in plastic, supported by plastic, glides within a plastic hole, and is made of plastic it actually feels really secure.  The only thing I don't like about it is that when you're reclining if you put your hands behind your head to stretch the muscles it just leaves a very ""hollow"" feeling (because it's hollow) and makes you wish there was something more there.

¤  The casters - They actually roll on my medium shag carpet with this chair easier than my former chair that was about 20lbs lighter and used the roller blade style casters.  I wouldn't recommend them on hardwood, waxed, marble, etc. floors because they are hard plastic, but they work great on carpet!

¤  Overall adjustments - For the cost - This is EASILY the most comfortable, and adjustable chair I'd have found.  Everything else that even came close was well over $500 after tax, so this was a no-brainer in every way possible.  Adjustable seat height, depth, tilt, arm height, arm tilt, arm angle, arm width, adjustable recline lock, adjustable recline tension, adjustable lumbar height, adjustable lumbar tension, adjustable headrest height, and angle...Find that anywhere else for this cost.  I dare you.

Is the chair perfect?  No.  There are several ways that they could have made minute changes to the design that would have EASILY made this a contender for the Herman Miller Embody, but they'd have come at more of a cost, and would remove this from being a contender for the Aeron - Which I fully believe it is.  My wife's current chair is a Reaction that we paid full MSRP (over $800) for some years back, and while it IS comfortable, it's not NEARLY as nice to sit in overall as this chair is at $320 total 'out the door' cost during this sale.

If you're on the fence, and thinking about any of the chairs that I listed in the beginning then do yourself a favor, and try this one first.  You literally have nothing to lose other than a few weeks of your time.

The shipping option is a damn nightmare.  Autonomous ONLY using UPS Ground resulted in me nearly throwing out my back just to get the chair because my driver refused to bring it up to me even after me calling FOUR tiers of supervisors and them TELLING him to.  The second day he was sent to redeliver it he was in the process of driving away because my leasing office was closed, and he didn't want to deliver it, so I banged on the side of his truck and said ""You've got my chair, right, go get it."" I'll be having another chat with his supervisor today over this fiasco.

If I could have chosen any other option I would have even if I had to pay $50 to have it shipped with a different company.  Keep that in mind, Autonomous.",4,0,TRUE,FALSE,"I wanted to hate this chair, but it's hard to..: I wanted to hate this chair JUST because I wanted UPS to have to come up to my steps and grab it because they refused to deliver it up the stairs for me two days in a row resulting in me having to lug it over my shoulder - a 3' x 4' box that weighed 70LBs with a bad back to get it.  I wanted that lazy driver to suffer, but I can't.  I just enjoy this chair WAY too much, so I'll have to devise another way to exact my revenge on his lazy butt.

At 36, and as a Programmer/Graphic Designer/3d Artist/Game Designer I spend WAY too much time at my desk.  More than I'm happy about, to be perfectly honest which equates to a LOT of potential for thoracic pain, tension migraines, pinched nerves, and sharp pains in my coccyx due to the last chair I had having springs in the seat and the padding wearing down.  
Because of all of these issues I've made the jump from ""executive chairs"" into proper ergonomic chairs in the hopes that it'll increase productivity, but also overall physical and emotional health.  Some of you reading this may know, and some may not, but even something as simple as posture correction can alleviate sinus congestion, migraines, frequent joint pains, and increase your mental well-being by a dramatic amount.  Hence my journey to find a proper ergonomic chair.

I've looked into Secretlab's Nueue, Office Depot's WorkPro Quantum 9000, and 12000, Herman Miller's ENTIRE lineup, Steelcase's Leap and Gesture, and EVERY ergonomic chair on amazon, read HUNDREDS of reviews regarding the Ergo Chair 2 and even watched countless videos from BTOD.  I am aware of all the people whining on reddit about this being a ""third-party Chinese chair"" (which it IS - and is the exact same price as the wholesale cost before you go getting the wrong opinion) but what they don't realize is that it's REALLY common in the furniture industry for brands to utilize this method.  It works for the Chinese companies because they get to expand their market, and it helps U.S. companies expand their business, and product line as well.

Ultimately I came to the conclusion that I would try out the Ergo Chair 2 for TWO reasons even though I'd never sat in it:
1.  I know the stipulations of the return very well, and took note to record my unpackaging experience to ensure that IF I decided to return the chair - it'd be right back the same way it came, and I have 30 days to acclimate to the chair and decide whether it's the right fit for me, and my work environment.

2.  With the blog subscription promo code, and the black Friday sale I was able to get the Ergo Chair 2 for $320 after tax, and that's pretty hard to pass up for a chair with this much customization a 2-year warranty, and a 30-day no questions asked return period.

So here's my overall thoughts - as someone that WANTED to hate this chair and company just to spite a lazy prick, and is typing in it right now...

¤  Customer support - I spoke to them prior to the order being shipped out because there was an uninformed delay on getting it out of the warehouse and requested to cancel.  While preparing to cancel the order for me the rep informed me that ""due to Thanksgiving it could take a bit longer to receive the funds back"" to which I said ""oh, I keep forgetting about Thanksgiving, I'll go ahead and wait and see if I like it then"" and the order was continued to be put through.  They're MORE than willing to ensure that you don't have any second thoughts and discuss any concerns you might have over live-chat, so feel free to contact them!

¤  Packaging - The box (which has a second box within it and another box within that containing the casters, and a few other small parts) came SLIGHTLY damaged (which I'll discuss in the cons section) but it was in areas and ways that I could tell it was because of UPS's handling procedures, and NOT a direct result of any mishandling, or recycled packaging.  Everything is wrapped in foam, cardboard, and bubble wrap - LITERALLY - My seat pan, and the seat back had a foam pad on top of it surrounded by bubble wrap, and enclosed in it's own portion of the box.  The packaging is TOP NOTCH!

¤  Assembly - Assembly was fairly straight-forward, and considerably easier than some of the chairs I've had to assemble in the past while working for OfficeMax as a Furniture Dept. Supervisor.  There are a FEW quirks that I hope eventually get ironed out such as the instructions not showing where to screw the headrest bolts into - and the headrest portion not being 100% flat resulting in me having to alternate torque between the two bolts to ensure that I didn't strip the holes, but both of those should fall under ""common-sense"" when building something, so it's not that big of a deal.

Assembling the arm portions was a bit of a nuisance in that you have to flip the seat pan upside down and there's no indicator for left, or right or front and back on the arms which made me have to do it twice, and I didn't figure that out until I'd already built the entire chair, and went to sit in it.  So I had to flip the assembled chair over, and remove both arms, then alternate the location.  A simple sticker could have prevented this from being an issue, and is a large oversight since the design of the chair made taking the arms off REALLY complicated once assembled due to lack of room for the included tool not to catch on the control handles, and ultimately scuff them.

¤  Lumbar - The lumbar (I took mine apart from the chair to see how it functioned - I do NOT recommend doing this without proper tools because it's nearly completely inaccessible, and a pain in the butt to reassemble without proper tools.) protrudes quite a bit, and although it's height adjustable it uses two ball-bearings press-fitted into brass pegs located within two holes on the lumbar that act as the ""retention mechanism"" and they work great for that, but for trying to move it they make it a nightmare.  There is a lever on the back of the seat-back that ""adjusts lumbar tension"" but on my chair specifically (maybe it's mis-manufactured) all it does is allow the chair to recline slightly more, and cause it to curl inward instead of stopping at a 90° upright position resulting in a LOT of pain on the ""reduced tension"" mode while sitting up.  While leaning back it DOES reduce pressure, but I feel like a simple tension knob and a spring would have been WORLDS better (although I do love the recline!)  

¤  Mesh back - It's comfortable, but not at the same time.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but once your skin gets used to it you'll be fine.  The first day it was VERY itchy, and kept irritating my skin, but the 2nd day I brushed it with a soft bristle-brush that I have to remove any dead skin particles, dust, etc. and cleaned up the chair (as I will continue to do every day) and since then it's been fine, so I think that's just some leftover fibers from the manufacturing.  It's strong, rigid, but also has a decent elasticity to it that is comforting.  I'm not a fan of mesh because I know that MOST manufacturers aren't going to take it's mounting seriously and someone's going to fall backward.  I doubt that's going to happen with this chair.  The mesh is more elasto-polymer (stretchy plastic) than ""mesh"" and due to that could easily be melted into the press-fit that holds it in place, and if I had a bet I'd say that's exactly what they've done because I don't see this giving way any time soon.  The breathability is great, and it's odd, but the amount of sound I realized I was never hearing from behind me until now is disturbing.  Solid-back chairs RUIN sound stage for studio sound setups.

¤  The seat - The seat is a point of contention for a number of buyers of any chair, and there are many reasons, but I'll stick with the ones people tend to rate this chair lowly - It bottoms out easily.  I spoke to customer support during my ""I think I want to cancel"" idiocy, and the lady I spoke with said that she hasn't had that problem personally, and initially I thought she was just doing her ""I'm going to try to make sure we get the sale"" tactic - until I sat in the seat a little longer and realized ...
It's REALLY hard to tell that it's bottoming out.  I weigh 170LB's and am ""average build"" in every way possible, and although I DO bottom out the seat the cushion still supports me and I feel it underneath me in a way that is really confusing until you get used to it.  I don't feel any tension in my legs, or loss of circulation, etc. and I suffer from ""no ass at all"" so it's EASY for me to get uncomfortable in a chair, and I've been in this one for 4 hours already today before writing this review, and it's fine.  I've tested sitting cross-legged, and crossing each individual foot underneath the opposite leg, and the seat does great at providing enough padding for this sitting style even IF it's not ergonomically advisable.

¤  The arms - These are the only part of the chair that I legitimately can NOT stand.  The 'mechanism' for the side, and front to back movement is probably the laziest design I've ever seen a company take.  They formed channels for the arm to move, and assemble it in a way to where it just allows you to move them left/right, forward/backward.  There's no lock, and because it's all done in plastic it does squeak that VERY annoying squeak that plastic grinding plastic gives you.  The up/down mechanism locks, but it's only in increments, and not exactly where you need it to be, so you either have to sacrifice arm-height, desk height, or chair height in order to get it perfectly level with your desk's surface area like it's supposed to be.  I've found that my arms don't move as ""freely"" side to side, or forward and back as some people have said they do, but I'm sure over time that they will just because of their design.

4,2020-11-20T10:08:09Z,20-Nov,Mr.,"Dear Autonomous team,
I have purchased the ergochair2 in November and have been using it ever since. Although the chair has made a tremendous difference from the kitchen chair, i am inclined to provide the following constructive criticism:
1. Quick delivery
2. Easy to assemble;
3. The look is very nice but I would like to say that the all black model looks more like a black and grey model ( I was not sure initially whether the right chair had arrived);
4. Overall very comfortable but I would say that for long period of time being seated, the cushion seems a bit too thin for me in comparison to other chairs that I used which in turn causes a slight fatigue of the rear.

4,2020-11-20T10:03:51Z,20-Nov,My Review - Ergo 2,"I have had my Ergo chair 2 for about 3 weeks now and love it.  It is nicely designed and comfortable for me.  The only 2 issues I have with the chair are minor:
 
1 - The hard rubber armrests are not comfortable at all and actually caused me elbow and forearm pain.  I had to order cushioned armrests in order to remedy this and now everything is fine.  It would be great if you guys offered different arm rests if possible.  Even if it was an add on cost, I would happily pay a few extra dollars for cushioned armrests.

2 - There needs to be a way for the armrests to be secured in a desired position.  I find that the armrests move constantly back and forth or side to side and never stay in a place that I want them.  I understand that they were designed to be adjustable, but If you could add in a knob or tightener that would hold the armrests in the same spot, that would be huge.

Overall, this chair is great and is worth every penny.  Please keep up the good work and putting out great products.

4,2020-11-10T09:24:44Z,10-Nov,Almost everything I wanted in a chair.,"This is a sleek-looking, well-built chair for a reasonable price. The materials appear quality, but I have not had the chair for long enough (1 month) to determine long-term durability. It's reasonably comfortable with many adjustable options to keep your posture. For context, I am 5'7"" and about 160lbs. 

Pros: 
- Looks cool, but still professional - none of that ""gamer"" aesthetic.
- Feels durable. All the adjustments and locks stay in place and don't creek (at least not yet).
- The mesh is nice. This is my first mesh back chair, and now I'm a fan. The balance of contour to support is just right. 
- Lots of adjustment options. this chair has almost every adjustment I need to sit ergonomically, with only a few exceptions below.
Cons:
- Armrests do not lock. The top of the arm rest is always loose, moving around if you shift your elbows too much or apply lateral pressure. This is annoying in many situations. 
- No lumbar adjustment. They advertise a lumbar adjustment, but it's misleading. There is a lever to switch between two levels of support, but it varies between ""a lot"" and ""break my spine"". Personally, I have a very straight posture, and lumbar support drives me crazy. I REALLY wish I could push that stupid pad back. It's the only thing that becomes uncomfortable about this chair over long periods.
- The seat doesn't tilt. I know it's not technically ergonomic, but sometimes I like to lean back in a ""bucket"" by tilting both the back and the seat. You cannot do that with this chair.

So, I wanted to be sure to add it for whoever may read my review. 

The ErgoChair Pro is a great bang for buck. In all honesty, the fit and finish are pretty on par with what I expected but definitely impressed by the comfort and adjustability. Coming from an Aeron, you do notice the differences in feel and smoothness of operation but again, it is what you expect especially since the price points are so different between the two. Part of my decision to move away from the Aeron was that I needed a headrest and had been following Autonomous for a few years. So figured I would give them a shot.  With that said, I do have to say that aside from what was expected, I am pretty impressed overall. Though, I do find the seat cushion a little firm, it is still comfortable and sits well for a long period of time. I have not noticed that the cushion is any warmer than my previous chair. The crank to adjust lean tension does not seem to work, or works too incrementally, but I do not think that is a negative against the chair. To be honest, I have yet to find any chair that the lean tension noticeably adjusts for me. Also, I wish the wheel arms on the bottom were a smidge longer. Always have used those to put my feet on, but now, I have to tuck my legs under to get them on there. 

I think improvements that I would like to see are:
-better material on the arm rests
-a negative tilt on the seat pan - you can tilt it forward (ie front goes down) but you cannot tilt it back, even slightly. I have gotten used to the position, but sometimes I feel like I am trying to prevent myself from sliding off the front. 
- more incremental adjustment on the back tilt lock - there is a lever that will limit how far back you can lean which is awesome, but the first applicable place it lets me lock in, is a smidge too far back. If it was 1/4 or 1/2 of the lean degrees less, it would be perfect. 
- back lean tension crank provided noticeable adjustment
- a more stable feel to where the hydraulic post goes into the seat pan. Every so often, I can feel the wobble of the seat on the post and it is just a blatant reminder that it is a ""budget"" chair. 

The improvements are not really negatives to me. Again, this chair is an awesome bang for buck and now that I have tuned it in a little more, I like it more and more.

""Can I purchase a longer gas lift and replace the current one? If so, what's the specification?

It's only the tops with the armrests.  They can either slide forward/backward or side/side.  It's just disappointing that in a chair that otherwise exemplifies Autonomous' attention to detail, they let this one slide (HAHA GET IT?).

I had a crap chair and needed to upgrade. The ErgoChair2 seemed the best combination of price and quality so I went for it.  I've been using the chair for about 10 days now and so far, I am mostly satisfied.

I ordered my chair online on Oct 2 and it showed up at my house on Oct 14. Somewhat of a long delivery but given the covid situation with so many people working from home and ordering chairs, understandable.

Putting it together was pretty easy and did not take very long. Autonomous has done a great job to make it possible for anyone to put it together without difficulty.

There are two reasons for 4 stars instead of five as well as my use of terms above such as ""mostly satisfied"" and ""almost all aspects.”

First, the back-tilt tension does not get strong enough. I have the tension cranked all the way up to the strongest it can be, and I can still get that “falling” feeling when I lean back due to it moving back too fast.

Second, I feel that the cushion could use a bit more “cushion.” This may just be a personal preference thing, but I am not a heavy person and it feels like I’ve sunk the cushion to the point where it is “bottomed out.” It could also be that I need to give it some time to allow my body to get used to it, but during this initial period of use it has caused some pain at the very lowest point of my back that rests on the chair cushion (my butt I guess – heh).

Some of the nylon threads that form the back support are frayed along the edge of the frame and jab into the back of my arm. I'm hoping they just weren't trimmed and this isn't a sign that the chair isn't going to last.

4,2020-10-15T09:47:32Z,15-Oct,"Overall a great chair for the price point, albeit with some flaws","Since I started working remotely, I realized my old leather executive chair just wouldn't do. It was an ergonomic nightmare to sit in for longer than an hour, and Iw as experiencing a lot of back, shoulder, and neck pain. I tried out a couple of chairs that I returned before landing on the ErgoChair Pro. Here are my thoughts:

Pros:
- I love the aesthetic look of the chair, especially in all black  with the grey mesh. It's a chair that has a clean modern look that is eye-catching, without feeling overly-stylized.
- The sheer amount of adjustability to position yourself for the best ergonomic fit is very good for the price point compared to other chairs. Specifically, I like the option to have a more vertical orientation, which I prefer when working, compared to the slightly reclined position that other chairs sometimes have as a default.
- The mesh back and adjustable lumbar padding provides excellent back support that is firm, but also has just enough give to support my spine throughout.
- The adjustable headrest  is tall enough to support my head. Many other chairs I've tried had headrests that were too short for me.
- The seat base of this chair is much wider than other chairs, which I love. I am actually able to sit cross-legged in this chair when I want to switch up my seating position. I couldn't do this in other chairs, since they were either too narrow or had steeper slopes towards the edges of the seat base compared to the ErgoChair Pro.

Cons:
- Armrests have a hard plastic feel that was actually painful for me to rest on for any significant period of time. The concave shape also contributes to added pressure on the elbows and forearms when typing. It was bothersome enough that I was actually considering returning this chair, but I found relatively cheap third-party armrest cushions from Amazon that helped to mitigate the issues with the hard plastic and shape of the armrests for now.
- Padding in the seat cushion is a little lacking. It feels a little too firm at times, most likely due to lack of sufficient padding between your bottom and the hard plastic base of the chair. I'm 160lbs so I imagine a heavier individual may find it even more uncomfortable. I wish the padding would've provided more cushion and a plush feel, especially for the price point. 
- I was excited to have a seat tilt function, but was disappointed that there's only two positions (flat and tilted forward) to lock into place. I wanted to be able to fine-tune the tilt to sit comfortably and reduce pressure on my thighs, but having only two tilt options doesn't allow for this.
- I wish this chair had the built in footrest like the ErgoChair Core does. There are times I would like to switch my position and lounge with my laptop, and a footrest would be an amazing addition to this chair to allow this.

Overall I love the features, and buying separate armrest cushions helped with the one major flaw I was experiencing with the ErgoChair Pro. Although this chair is not perfect, and I would love to see some of these improvements addressed in a future updated model, the fact is you won't be able to find a chair with comparable features at this price point.",4,0,TRUE,FALSE,"Overall a great chair for the price point, albeit with some flaws: Since I started working remotely, I realized my old leather executive chair just wouldn't do. It was an ergonomic nightmare to sit in for longer than an hour, and Iw as experiencing a lot of back, shoulder, and neck pain. I tried out a couple of chairs that I returned before landing on the ErgoChair Pro. Here are my thoughts:

Pros:
- I love the aesthetic look of the chair, especially in all black  with the grey mesh. It's a chair that has a clean modern look that is eye-catching, without feeling overly-stylized.
- The sheer amount of adjustability to position yourself for the best ergonomic fit is very good for the price point compared to other chairs. Specifically, I like the option to have a more vertical orientation, which I prefer when working, compared to the slightly reclined position that other chairs sometimes have as a default.
- The mesh back and adjustable lumbar padding provides excellent back support that is firm, but also has just enough give to support my spine throughout.
- The adjustable headrest  is tall enough to support my head. Many other chairs I've tried had headrests that were too short for me.
- The seat base of this chair is much wider than other chairs, which I love. I am actually able to sit cross-legged in this chair when I want to switch up my seating position. I couldn't do this in other chairs, since they were either too narrow or had steeper slopes towards the edges of the seat base compared to the ErgoChair Pro.

Cons:
- Armrests have a hard plastic feel that was actually painful for me to rest on for any significant period of time. The concave shape also contributes to added pressure on the elbows and forearms when typing. It was bothersome enough that I was actually considering returning this chair, but I found relatively cheap third-party armrest cushions from Amazon that helped to mitigate the issues with the hard plastic and shape of the armrests for now.

Total time of ownership: 4 months
Average time in chair: 8-12 hours
Chair replaced: Herman Miller Aeron B after 4 years of abuse.

Chair Pros:
1. Adjustable to force posture - Like this a lot. Some adjustment pieces I didn't even know I wanted.
2. Adjustable on allowing me to embrace my tired when I want it. (aka poor posture, pure comfort)
3. It supports me well on my posture as well as my weight.
4. Supports my arms well. The arm rest actually supports my arms at desk height of about 31"". Most chairs don't even have arm rests that will reach
5. Material is breathable and reduces sweat when the shop gets warmer during the summer

Room to grow:
1. The arm rests do not allow for a fixed position. This is not all bad, by any means just would be a nice to have.
2. The seat cushion. It ""feels"" as if the cushion tapers thinner as you get close to the back and some times I can tell when I am sitting in ""perfect posture"" mode with my butt all the way in the back position that the cushion is maybe bottoming out. I have taken some advice from this chair: 1. When I feel this I get up and take a walk because I have been sitting  at the computer for 4 to 5 hours. 2. I clearly need to lose the weight so the chair is a nice reminder of this in a polite manner
3. The wheels for this price are your standard task chair wheels. I went on Amazon and replaced them with roller blade wheels which also adds a nice extra height so I don't have to extends the piston as much reducing the wear and tear of the unit.
4. Seat cushion. Being in R&D and manufacturing I understand that some changes come at a cost on design, materials, and logistics. However, I would love if you could find a way to do a nice breathable mesh similar to my Aeron B for an all around experience.

I clearly need to lose the weight so the chair is a nice reminder of this in a polite manner
3. The wheels for this price are your standard task chair wheels. I went on Amazon and replaced them with roller blade wheels which also adds a nice extra height so I don't have to extends the piston as much reducing the wear and tear of the unit.
4. Seat cushion. Being in R&D and manufacturing I understand that some changes come at a cost on design, materials, and logistics. However, I would love if you could find a way to do a nice breathable mesh similar to my Aeron B for an all around experience. The biggest trap to this request would be around coming up with a stand off structure that would mount above the piston/control and putting the mesh seat on the stand off structure to allow enough clearance depth to not have someone bottom out into the piston/control area."

4,2020-07-14T13:38:11Z,14-Jul,Just a good chair.,"I'll admit I was hesitant at first to purchase an ErgoChair Pro due to the price, but after seeing the plethora of written and video reviews of the chair I pulled the trigger and I'm glad I did. Compared to other ergonomic chairs, this is one of the more modestly priced options and I think it hits most of the features you would want spot on. You can adjust almost anything you can think of on the chair and the headrest is a huge plus (and something I thought I wouldn't like). The mesh back and headrest keep my back cool and free of sweat and the lumbar support adds a surprising layer of comfort for someone coming from a cheap office chair.

4,2020-07-02T12:28:36Z,2-Jul,Very supportive. Scratchy cushion.,"After spending a couple months with my new ErgoChair, I suppose it's time to give it a review. For a little background, I am at my desk from anywhere from 1 to 14 hours a day, depending on the day. Since working from home, I spend more time at my desk than ever. Per week, I'm working 40 hours, and I spend probably another 8 to 20 hours a week gaming, working on home projects, doing hobbies, or doing my personal finances. I'm in my late 20s, I'm 6 feet tall, and I weigh 260 pounds. My partner also works from home, and we both had very cheap desk chairs that were really not good for more than a couple hours of use at a time. Our backs were constantly sore and we were taking ibuprofen like it was candy to deal with the soreness. After doing some research, I came upon this chair, and we decided to junk both of our old chairs and buy two of them. For the chair itself, it's probably one of the best chairs in the sub-$500 range you'll find. The supports are pretty easily customized, the lumbar support hits me in just the right spot, the back of the seat conforms to my shape pretty well, the headrest is nice to have for days I want to lean back a little, and the headrest feels pretty supportive, even if it's not very good at staying in place. It does not squeak or wobble. All of the components feel pretty high quality, which is a huge bonus in this price range. Best of all, our backs haven't felt this good in months. I was taking 400-800 mg of ibuprofen a night just to get to sleep. Now my back doesn't hurt at all. Assembly was fairly straightforward. We buy a lot of flat-pack furniture so the concept is not new to us. It's definitely much easier to do with a second person, but is also entirely possible to do alone. Autonomous includes an Allen wrench for assembly. If you prefer to use your own, be sure you have a 5 mm. Otherwise, the included tool is adequate and is all you'll need to do the job. As for things that are minor nitpicks. The armrests move about freely. They do lock into place going up or down, but forward and lateral movements are free and so they move around everywhere. The headrest does have divets to keep it in place, but they're not very strong so it does move around unintentionally from time to time. The lumbar support locks in place the same way the headrest does, but this one is a little hard to adjust (bad). However, once it's in place, it doesn't really move around (good) so I suppose that one evens itself out. My major knock against this chair is the seat cushion. In a way, this is where the rubber meets the road. I wear a lot of shorts. I'm working from home due to a certain ""the world is on fire"" event happening in the first half of 2020. And if I'm going to have to work from home, I'm going to wear comfortable clothes, not nice clothes. So gym shorts and a white T-shirt it is! The problem created here is that the fabric used on the seat cushion is not as high quality as the rest of the chair. It's extremely rough. It rubs the backs of my calves a lot to the point that it gets painful after a half hour. I keep a spare pillowcase on the cushion to help, but it slides off a lot so it's a bit of a hassle. I'm having trouble finding a cover that will slide onto the chair kind of like a fitted sheet, but those are a little hard to find. So while it's not ideal, this is the solution that, more or less, works for me. All in all, this is a great chair. If you're thinking about picking it up and you've looked at other options, I can definitely recommend this chair. It does come with a few caveats. If you're the kind of person who will wear shorts a lot in this chair, you might consider other options with better cushion material. The padding is good, but the covering is abysmal. Still, if you can mitigate that, it doesn't ruin the experience. Despite the few flaws it has, the major driving point of this chair is the price. It's one of the best chairs competing in this segment for your money, especially if you can wait a few weeks for manufacture and delivery (it took about 5 for us). If you come across it while it's on sale, that's even better. You just can't beat having a very supportive chair. Pros: + Price is nearly unbeatable + Wonderfully ergonomic + Sturdy construction + Easy to assemble + All necessary tools included + Armrests easily adjust upward and downward, and lock solidly into place + Lumbar and back supports are firm, yet are very conforming Neutrals: = Armrests do move forward and back, side to side freely = Other adjustments do lock, but are easily moved about anyway = Lumbar support is a little hard to adjust and it's very hard to make fine adjustments to it.

Pros: - Literally everything on this chair is adjustable, and it's incredible. I was able to get the headrest and lumbar support *exactly* where I wanted them. - The head rest tilt adjustment is great. The tilted-back position provides the perfect alignment for me, but the tilted-forward position forces my head forward and encourages me to slouch. I wouldn't use the headrest if it didn't have the ability to tilt back. - Very easy to put together, although I was a bit worried at the end when I saw extra screws... I then realized the chair came with an extra of every screw and washer. - The mesh is very comfortable and breathable. The back of the chair doesn't force my shoulders forward like some other high-end office chairs (e.g. an Aeron). - The ""Black &amp; White"" color option is a nice mixture of stylish and classy. Cons: - The armrest material is a bit too firm - there's no give to the material unless you really lean your weight on it. It doesn't pass the ""flick test"" -- flick it as hard as you can; if it hurts, the surface is too hard. This is so noticeable that I might look into getting a thin gel or foam cover for each armrest. - The lateral movement of the armrests doesn't lock. However, this is only a minor annoyance, as they mostly stay in place unless I brace myself on the armrests to adjust my seating position. - The seat doesn't quite go low enough -- the minimum seat high is just an inch or two too high.

The chair arrived within 2 days of ordering and was easy to assemble. It provides good back support, though the cushion could be better but is generally comfortable to sit in for long periods of time (I work from home as developer and can easily sit in my chair upwards of 10-12 hours a day). The chair features many adjustments that rival chairs twice it's price, which is awesome but certain aspects of them feel quite cheap. For example, there's a lot of movement in the headrest and armrests with little tension, so they have quite a bit of ""wiggle"" room. The mechanisms that they move on and their locks, are also relatively cheap. Even when locking the armrest height, you can still move them up and down about a CM (half an inch) and they wiggle side to side. There's no way to lock the armrest position. The reclining mechanism works very well and is tension adjustable. You can also lock the reclining, which has a bit of movement while locked as well but feels more acceptable than the armrests. Overall, I think the chair is comfortable and a good entry into more ""premium"" chairs. This lacks the build quality of something like a Steelcase or Herman Miller, but you get what you pay for.

Do not expect packaging that Greenpeace would approve of, but do expect that your chair parts will be intact and pristine. After nearly 10 minutes of unpacking the parts, the chair went together easily enough. There was one issue where the screw holds on the metal seat base did not align correctly to the seat cushion, but I just ""muscled"" it and made it work. This is the only area of slight disappointment because it does suggest an issue with either the plastic seat mold or that the metal piece possibly comes from multiple vendors that may not all use the exact same specs. Assembly took approximately 25 minutes with the help of my 8 year old. The quality of the plastic on the chair is very good.

One disappointing thing that has failed is that the plastic/foam of the left arm rest is starting to split/tear away.

4,2018-12-14T00:00:00Z,14-Dec,,"Everything about this chair is great.  If you have been looking for a good ergonomic replacement for your office chair, this is one I could recommend.  That is, if you happen to weigh less than 248 lbs.  It's not good in that aspect but eh what are you gonna do.

Let's list some positives
+ Everything is Adjustable
+ Lets your get the posture and sitting position you desire for maximum comfort
+ No longer need to strain my neck to draw.  Adjustable back means I can give myself something to lean on without needing to lean so far back and crane my neck.  Major reason why I got this chair

Alright now let's list some negatives
- Seat is a bit too firm for me.  I'd prefer something with a little more give.
- Being able to lower the seat but not the chair (if that makes sense) would be nice.  Especially considering I have needed to use a seat cushion for better butt support.  This, unfortunately, messes with the natural balance of the way this was designed.  This is not a fault on autonomous, but I think being able to adjust the height of the back might be helpful for some. (in case of a future model)
- The chair does not raise and lower as much as I would like, but there's probably good reason for this
- Arm Rests are just plain hard.  Is this so you can buy your own cushions?  I understand the gesture if that was the reason, but to be frank I'd rather just have something comfortable from the get go (or at least an option to buy from them)
- Neck support is not quite what I was hoping for.  No matter the position, I cannot lay back and rest my neck back while also being able to comfortably view whatever I'm working on.  I think if ever a future model is a built, a means of being able to push the neck support forward (so I can lean back into it AND compute) and lock it would be nice

Now you might think ""well hold on that's way more negatives than positives"" but keep in mind that just because I mentioned off lots of negatives does not mean that this chair isn't good.  In fact quite the opposite is true.  These are just constructive criticisms I have for the product that I'd like to hope could be addressed in future models of this chair.

Trust me, I did months of research & this was it at the time of purchase. Although I haven't looked again in several months, I wouldn't be able to afford to anyway & I'm grateful to Autonomous for making this so affordable compared to other options. The only reasons why it doesn't get 5 stars I'll list below. But please don't let what I'm about to say effect your purchase, because the only way you'll truly know if any chair is right for you is to just try it.

1: The arm rests are too long & or don't slide back far enough. This makes it impossible to scoot up to your desk enough if your goal is to have the arms at around the same height as the desk top which is the most ergonomic. 2: I'm not sure what type of foam the seat cushion is made out of but I think it could be more durable. Although I do spend a lot of time in the chair, I only weight 145lbs & I can tell the foam is starting to break down after 6 months. It's not totally mush but having relatives in upholstery, I know there are higher grades of foam with similar firm/softness that would last longer.

Finally, the back just doesn't work for me, I've adjusted it every way I can & I've been to a chiropractor to fix the damage my previous sunken in swivel rocker caused. I still experience significant discomfort after a few hours of total sit time even if I take 5 minute breaks every hour. If I set the chair to rock this helps a lot but because of how far forward the arms always are they keep knocking against the desk. Truthfully I & many other PC users just need elbow rests, not full arm rests. My advice to any potential buyers is first go to a Chiropractor if you suspect your back is misaligned from previous sitting prior to purchase. Then get this chair on the 30 day risk free trial & work with your Chiropractor to adjust it properly. If it feels comfortable enough then great, you'll be able to enjoy this chair for a long time as many others have too.

It's not totally mush but having relatives in upholstery, I know there are higher grades of foam with similar firm/softness that would last longer.

Finally, the back just doesn't work for me, I've adjusted it every way I can & I've been to a chiropractor to fix the damage my previous sunken in swivel rocker caused. I still experience significant discomfort after a few hours of total sit time even if I take 5 minute breaks every hour. If I set the chair to rock this helps a lot but because of how far forward the arms always are they keep knocking against the desk. Truthfully I & many other PC users just need elbow rests, not full arm rests. My advice to any potential buyers is first go to a Chiropractor if you suspect your back is misaligned from previous sitting prior to purchase. Then get this chair on the 30 day risk free trial & work with your Chiropractor to adjust it properly. If it feels comfortable enough then great, you'll be able to enjoy this chair for a long time as many others have too. Unfortunately I can't but it's at least keeping my spine healthier than what I had, that's not Autonomous's fault though, they made a good chair, it's just everyone's back is different."

The adjustability of is top notch. I often just go sit in it when my back pain flares up over laying on my memory foam bed, it's just that good.

Things I do not like...

The armrests are not padded and while they have a lot of adjustability, then cannot be locked in place so just trying to use them can move them around.

Worst of all is the headrest though. It is sort of comfy but if you are wearing any sort of headphones (which I do since I do a lot of gaming) you pretty much can't turn your head. Also, the mesh is certainly good but without any actual padding, the edges of the headrest can be painful as it's pretty hard where the mesh is attached.

For a follow-up model, I would certainly use padding on the armrests and make them lockable. The headrest should be redesigned completely.

4,2018-08-20T00:00:00Z,20-Aug,I like the Ergo Chair a lot... but...,"There are 3 reasons I bought this chair: The main and almost sole reason is because it has a headrest. SO many chairs do not have headrests and I do not understand that. PLEASE do not stop making them with headrests. I will buy from you as long as you have a headrest on your chairs. That being said, the second reason was the customizable features of the chair and how I can make it fit to my figure however I would like. THAT is HUGE. And lastly, the price point was excellent... not too cheap... not too expensive.... just right for what you get with this chair. All that to be said, I have a few things that you should consider on your next go around.

Please please PLEASE make the headrest more 'moveable.' By that I mean I would like to be able to bring it forward more than it is currently capable of. Currently I feel like I have to sit fairly far back away from my keyboard/desk in order to rest my neck on the headrest. I would VERY much appreciate the ability to move it more. Along those same lines, you guys have designed a step-by-step clicking mechanism on the headrest, and it would be MUCH better if I could just set it myself with a locking, screw-type piece that makes it stay in one position because if I lean into the headrest too much, it clicks back to the other settings and it's really loud and hurts a bit.

The armrest is my only other beef with it. It's very squeaky and does not lock into place. I would like to lock the armrest in place so that it doesn't move around while I'm working. The squeaky sound is really annoying too. Last item for the armrest is the comfort of it... it's not comfortable... it kind of feels like I'm resting my arm on a wooden desk with a bit more of a give. I'm not a fan of that. Comfort would be AWESOME in the next iteration of this chair.

I am pretty picky on chairs... and you have managed to make me rather satisfied. So I want to encourage you with that. I hope you take this criticism as constructive and I look forward to what you guys come up with next.

4,2018-01-15T22:30:45Z,15-Jan,,"Shipping and packaging: The chair was shipped on time and delivered on time. It was decently packaged and double boxed. Each item was wrapped with bubble wrap and then protected with cardboard. Screws and washers were included in a sealed easy to ready package that allows you to identify which ones are needed for which step. Tool need is also included. Only thing you need is a knife to cut open the boxes. Assembly and build: Fairly straightforward and easy. Most of the parts have oblong holes. There is lots of play room. The base of the chair assembly to the seat cushion had tons of adjustment for alignment that is was hard to tell if the base would be better center align or align to the top. (I don't think this made a difference). This process did not call for lock washer, which I find it surprising. The back assembly to the base of the seat is installed with 3x M6 ( Actually all the screws are M6 for the whole chair assembly) from hard plastic material to metal on the base. ( I have tightened all the way but I think over-tighten could cause the plastic to crack after long term usage). Arm assembly, each arm is mounted to the bottom of the base with three screws, this was fairly easy. (Although this made me wonder why the base mounting only had 4 screws and an arm had 3). Headrest assembly mounting didn't quite fit until I screwed it and it snapped in placed. Probably just bad tolerance. Overall the instruction was fairly easy to follow. I mistaken the screw head for an washer earlier as they included both the top view and side view of each screw. (Which took me a few minutes to understand once I read through the rest of the instruction.) Not sure why they did that as all the screw heads are M6. This might make it more confusing for some people. Adjustment instruction for comfort is also pretty straightforward. Test and Quality: Overall the quality of the chair seems ""Fair"". The quality of the plastic is above average but I did find small nicks and dents on the hard plastic after shipping. The seat cushion is very firm and the mesh is in good quality. I found a very faint discoloration of the mesh on the seat cushion, probably due to handling the production during manufacturing without proper gloves or hand wash. The height adjustment for head rest and back support is very stiff and very easy to over adjust (so if it is low and you pull it up expecting it to go up but it won't budge, then you apply more force and now it moves but it overshoots and now the thing is too high). The chair cushion / itself have a very distinct smell, tolerable but not faint. It is most likely the smell of the raw material from factory. (I expect this to go away within the first week).

5,2024-07-23T07:48:57Z,23-Jul,Highly recommend to anyone looking,"After 2 weeks and here's my thought for the chair: First thing I noticed, amazing lumbar support. I've never had a chair that supported my lower back so well. Not even the driver seat of my car gives me the support I need. Then there were all the nobs and levers under the seat. This is a bit much, even over 40 hours of sitting in the seat and it's still hard to memorize how to  adjust the chair as desired. And I'm really not a fan of the roll-up window lever either. Labels or icons would be nice. My favorite part of the chair is the headrest. I'm a tall guy so I've never really had a headrest that could reach my head properly. This chair reaches to just under my head, which lets me rest really comfortably. Once you have a headrest on your main chair, u wont go back. The armrests adjustability is definitely nice too. I have them all the way raised up and prefer them closer to my body. Unfortunately, the weight of my arms adjust them from time to time. Would like them to be tighter. Overall, I'm very comfortable while typing/gaming. Lastly, the mesh material for the backing. I think this is a key feature for people that run hot like me. It allows your body to breathe and not store up so much heat on your back. I'm able to stay in this seat much longer without getting uncomfortable (~4 hours straight). It's a great chair for developers and gamers. We tend to stay in one spot for hours on end and you should definitely be comfortable during that time. And not needing to take a break out of discomfort has helped get more work done. Highly recommend to anyone looking.

5,2023-11-28T19:04:06Z,28-Nov,Review of the Autonomous ErgoChair,"I recently purchased the Autonomous ErgoChair, and after a few days of use, I'm compelled to share my experience.

What’s Good About It:

Ergonomic Design: The chair's ergonomic design is its standout feature. It offers excellent lumbar support which has significantly reduced my back pain. The adjustable armrests, seat tilt, and headrest provide a customized seating experience that adapts to various body types.
Material Quality: The materials feel premium. The mesh back is breathable, making it comfortable for long hours of use, especially in warmer climates. The overall build quality gives the impression that this chair will last for years.

Aesthetics: Its sleek and modern design easily fits into any office setting. It doesn't just feel good to sit in; it looks good too.
Suggestions for Improvement:

Assembly Instructions: While the assembly is straightforward, the instructions could be clearer. Including a few more diagrams or a video tutorial would be helpful.

Seat Cushion: The seat cushion, although comfortable, could benefit from a bit more padding for those longer sitting periods.
Price Point: The chair is on the pricier side, which might not fit everyone's budget. A more budget-friendly option or payment plan could make it more accessible.

A few things to note:
-Chair is very easy to assemble, but the package is about 70 pounds, extremely heavy (but great quality)
-Packaging was great as well, kept everything from getting damaged

The one thing that I would consider a design flaw is the amount of levers under the chair, and trying to remember which lever does what.  Regardless, once the chair is assembled you likely will deal with this issue only once until you find your ideal settings.

5,2022-11-14T19:44:15Z,14-Nov,"Durable, comfortable, and planning to buy another after almost 3 years of enjoyment!","I bought an ErgoChair 2 at the beginning of the pandemic, when suddenly faced with the very real need to work from home for 10+ hours per day. Aand as much as Autonomous keeps making green chairs, then selling them at a steep discount, the vibrant splash of colour was a nice welcome to my improvised/now permanent office area in my apartment!

Now I bought the chair after seeing a number of ""influencers"" on youtube recommend it, but I did my research, the price point was reasonable, and unpaid reviewers who had purchased it on their own were giving it quite positive reviews. 

Shipping, assembly, and setup were all easy and quick, and I have nothing but positive things to say about the experience and product.

Full disclosure, I had an issue with the chair shortly after purchasing, when a few seat mounts suddenly broke, but a wonderfully receptive support agent was able to send me an entirely new seat assembly at no charge under the 2-year full coverage warranty!

Now, almost three years, and 10,000+ hours of use later, the chair is starting to see its age unsurprisingly, but I plan to keep using it for years to come (assuming I can buy a few out-of warranty replacement parts from the great support team!)

Either way, I've decided that my experience with this chair was so positive, I'm ordering a ErgoChair Pro (also in the cheap, but lively green color!) as soon as I finish this review, as an upgrade for my main desk, but I'd recommend the ErgoChair series of products to anyone after having made it a permanent fixture in my work at home life for the last 960-odd days!",5,0,TRUE,FALSE,"Durable, comfortable, and planning to buy another after almost 3 years of enjoyment!: I bought an ErgoChair 2 at the beginning of the pandemic, when suddenly faced with the very real need to work from home for 10+ hours per day.

It has a lot of the features that premium chairs like Herman Miller have but at a much better value. It was an EXCELLENT chair for a year and some change. It helped improve my posture.

Sitting for a long period of time is not healthy. However, standing for a prolonged time also doesnt make you healthier. It is thus important to maintain a good balance between sitting and standing while working or studying at the desk for a long duration.

I was a little reluctant, at first, to spend $400 on a chair, but after reading many reviews, and comparing it to far more expensive chairs, I decided to take the risk -- besides, they promise free returns and refunds within 30 days, so I figured I didn't have much to lose if it wasn't any good. Anyway, I'm very happy with it! It'll take you a couple of days to get everything adjusted just the way you like it, so definitely take some time with it -- there are *so many* different adjustments. My one complaint is the arm-rests. The height can be locked in place, so that's not an issue, but the movement of the armrests side-to-side and front-to-rear cannot be. They use simple friction to ""hold"" themselves in place, and there's no locking mechanism, so it's far too easy to bump the armrests out of position. It's not a huge deal at all -- it's not like they can slide completely out from under your elbows. And they don't slide around while you're sitting in the chair unless you lean on one and push in the right direction.

The story:
- tried many chairs, some better that others. The last one was horrible (looked good though :| ). 
- my back was starting to act up and my position on the chair was ...wrong.

The research (hard, not many good reviews for office chairs in general)
> started researching a lot of variants. 
- During the research a name was popping up through various forums and youtube videos - ErgoChair. just mentions and usually  a short comment ""not perfect, but great, i have it for years""
> then i found out the ErgoChair Pro exists 

The order:
- all fine, except some expected delays due to the current pandemic situation

The review:
- easy to setup (you may want some additional hands for a specific step, due to weight, but it is do-able alone)
- comfortable. quite nice to make small adjustments until you find the right configuration.
- sturdy/ well build. 
- the ergo parts adjustments are enough to help you find a very comfortable position
- actually usable headrest.
- wide and move-able armrests. My hand don't go to sleep while using it (it is quite common on bad chairs)
- armrest heigh adjustments steps are granular enough so i can find a proper position with interfering with the desk

Price:
- compared with other similar priced office chairs, this is better (note: the office chair market may differ from country to country)
- never felt that i overpaid based on construction, comfort and features

My light bad pain situation:
- much much better, almost gone. 

The bad (not Autonomous fault):
- scratched my floor with some small stones embedded on the outside of the huge box.

- sturdy/ well build. 
- the ergo parts adjustments are enough to help you find a very comfortable position
- actually usable headrest.
- wide and move-able armrests. My hand don't go to sleep while using it (it is quite common on bad chairs)
- armrest heigh adjustments steps are granular enough so i can find a proper position with interfering with the desk

Price:
- compared with other similar priced office chairs, this is better (note: the office chair market may differ from country to country)
- never felt that i overpaid based on construction, comfort and features

My light bad pain situation:
- much much better, almost gone. 

The bad (not Autonomous fault):
- scratched my floor with some small stones embedded on the outside of the huge box. 

PS: are you gamer and need a chair? Don't buy a gaming one, buy this one. Your hands, back, feet and other parts will be happy during long sessions"

One wish: make the headrest lockable, so that when someone heavy like me leans a bit harder on it, it does not adjust itself automatically."

5,2021-02-11T16:12:57Z,11-Feb,Almost Perfect,"This chair was very similar to the SIDIZ T50 chair I bought a few years back, except that it resolved a lot of the problems I had with the T50. Both chairs were extremely adjustable, but the ErgoChair Pro was much easier to figure out. The ErgoChair also came with a headrest, which was optional on the T50 and wasn't as adjustable. The seat cushion on the ErgoChair was also much thicker and more comfortable for long sessions. The lumbar support on the T50 did little but slightly jab a thin section of your spine with a hard piece of rubber, while the ErgoChair's lumbar support is robust and much more comfortable, sporting a large soft cushion that can easily be maneuvered into the ideal position. Finally, this chair is able to accommodate my awkward body shape (5'6"" with a long torso with short legs), allowing me to comfortably maintain the proper seating posture for long periods of time.

The only issue I have is relatively minor: the armrests are too fidgety. I love that they're so adjustable and can slide into a variety of positions, but I hate that they slide everywhere and can't maintain their positions. Unless I'm crazy and I missed something in the instructions, I don't think there's a way to lock the horizontal position of the armrests, and they'll merrily slide all over the place with the slightest touch. 

But again, that is a minor complaint. I've gone through thousands of dollars worth of chairs in my lifetime, and I've very rarely found any worth keeping.

I also very much like the design of the chair.  Personally, I think it has a very modern look, and is suitable if you're into a more minimalist design for your room or office.  I would post a picture of my office/room setup with the chair, but there are plenty of reviews with pictures, and I don't want to show the Internet my mess of a room.
As such, I would highly recommend the ErgoChair Pro given the price.  I wouldn't necessarily call it a ""budget"" ergonomic chair, but it is well worth its cost and it is still far more affordable than other ergonomic chairs you may see advertised.
My only critique is that you just have to be sure to have a roommate, family member, or friend ready to assist in the setup of the chair.

Even though I wish the armrest could be locked in one position, it is such a minor issue that it won't change my rating.

Ive been having some back issues that comes and goes due to an injury a few years back so looking for the best and most affordable chair was tough.

Ultimately, I decided to invest in the Ergochair only because it has many adjustable mechanics like headrest height/tilt, back tilt/tension/angle, seat tilt, lumbar support adjustment, handrest heightforward adjustment and of course the height of the seat. All these provide the flexibility for your own comfort!

The back material is mesh and breathable which conforms to your body and the seat is a cushion fabric which IMO couldve been worked on better. Ive read some reviews that the seat cushion becomes uncomfortable overtime for those that are over 200 lbs. I havent had any issues yet and I think its super comfortable for me to sit on, but they do have a trial period if you want to test the chair out for a month first.

Im not saying this chair is for everyone but I would recommend to those who are looking for good back support and sitting posture!

5,2020-12-01T11:13:40Z,1-Dec,Serious Review,"Before I bought this chair i used a foldable chair, like the ones you sit in at inexpensive community parties. That was unbearable uncomfortable. However after sitting in this chair it made all of the diffrence. However after 4 months of sitting I find it hard to properly set up and get comfortable.
1. The lumbar support i found it be difficult to set up, especially raising the lumbar pad.
2. I wish the arm rests were able to be moved in more tighter
3. I wish that the seat was more firm, and maybe there could be cooling gels added in later models
4. Adjusting the chair tilt is to aggressive between the defult setting and the next notch, I wish there was an inbetween. I dont know why some one would need to lean so far back. 
5. I wish there was more stability with the base. I find myself constantly tightening the seat to better mount it allas this keeps happening.
6. I wish the seat could tilt backwards instead of just forward.

Now here is the reality of this chair. Its great if you are sitting down and need to get stuff done. Properly set up you won't think of anything else. 
Also I love the fact that you can lean forward however this doesnt mean you will get close to your desk and the armrests will block you from getting closer. So I rarely use that feature. What would be cool if there was a multimidea keyboard mount for the chair. 

The real pros are the looks the neck rest and the wheels. The Neck rest is amazingly comfortable and the chair fits desktop set up.

Like many people during this COVID pandemic I have had to move to remote working full time.  In my normal office I have a Wave Ergo Chair that was some £650 and I thought it was perfect.  Trouble is that my site won't let us take the ""nice"" chairs home so I was stuck with my Ikea Marcus chair from a few years ago.  This proved to be really bad for any time over an hour sat at my desk.  I switched to a Giroflex G64 as my wife has one at home and it felt reasonable.  After a week I was ready to go full time standing at my sit stand desk as the chair was so bad.

I had seen the Autonomous ads on Instagram and Google so I thought I would give it a shot and went for the ErgoChair Pro.

This is by far one of the best chairs I have had and am thinking of asking my team in the office, should I ever return, to look into these for corporate use.  The amount of adjustment means that I can dial in the chair to match the type of work I am doing or how my back and neck feel on any given day.

No longer do I get random back spasms and neck ache but can comfortably sit through the most tedious of conference calls and have hosted a 4 hour major incident bridge call from the comfort of the chair.

5,2020-11-17T20:12:46Z,17-Nov,"Awesome chair, with one very minor annoyance.","First off let me say, I've had this chair under a month so I can't rate it's durability but it is extremely comfortable. I'm not a small dude... I'm 6'4"" and over 220 lbs but it still fits me great all the way up to the headrest. I bought it mainly because of the reviews and for comfort, but it looks fantastic as well. I got the one with the green ass just for the color contrast, and I'm assuming unless I spill something on it it will look good for quite a while. 

I'm still giving it five stars because of how comfortable it is, because it still averages out to at least a 9.5/10 but there is one annoyance. For this price, and with this comfort I'd say they spent their money in the right places, but they had to save some somewhere. The armrests for me work fine, and they adjust in height quite a bit which is nice. However, one side slides in and out like it should, and the otherside wiggles at an angle randomly while I'm working. Like not in and out, but the front will go in while the back stays still or vice-versa. It's definitely not a deal breaker, and if it was I'd buy a herman miller for $1,400. If nothing else I wish they'd offer aftermarket armrests that might cost a little more, or an afterthought purchase but would be a big upgrade to an almost perfect chair.

5,2020-11-11T09:56:36Z,11-Nov,Is good but there are some things to note,"I have had this chair for a few months now and it feels nice and custom to my body. The pros:
-its customizable, you can adjust height, backrest tension, lumbar support and adjustment, arm rest, angle of the backrest, angle/tilt of the seat itself, and height and angle of the headrest.
-the meshed material holding your back lets it breath out so you don't feel hot at all.
-the seat cushion feels good
-great color options, I ordered the grey and white option
-this is probably my favorite. Surprisingly, the headrest is really well designed. Its all thanks to the curvature. when you lay your head back on it, the shape of it means that its really comfortable when you turn and rest your head on its side. After pouring hours to days in searching for the best chair for me, none had this kind of headrest design.

cons:
-the back support although is adjustable, i feel like it isn't enough. no matter how i use this chair, i don't feel like i can fully take advantage of the lumbar adjustment which was one of the main reasons i chose this chair versus the thousands of options out there.
-probably my biggest con here is the arm rests. you can adjust the position of them; move them left and right, forward and back, height, but that's the problem. To adjust the height, you have to press a button under the armrest so that they keep the position you want them; that feature is not present on the other ways to adjust the arm rest meaning they are constantly loose. they constantly shift left, right, forward and the angle which is more annoying than you'd expect. Its troublesome enough to justify returning the chair but i can make it work somehow.
-another problem for the armrest, the length is too short. as stated before, you can move the armrest slightly forward but that still makes them uncomfortable. the armrests can feel longer if you recline the back but even when you do that and move the armrest as far forward as it can go, it is still lacking in length. This may not be an issue for some but I would expect more form a ~$350 chair. They are slightly padded and not exactly hard but it feels so cheap and somewhat uncomfortable.
-there is an oval shaped silver decorational piece on both sides of the chair located on the part of the back that supports the reclining feature; one of them falls out occasionally and is rather frustrating to keep on, I'm considering super gluing them on. I'll see if I can post some pictures for you all to see.
-I wish you can lower the height of the chair more, i play guitar which requires one leg to be higher than the other as that is where the guitar rests and if the chair could go any lower that would have been perfect. The maximum height the chair can go is also laughable.

The armrests are individually attached just by 3 screws each, I sincerely hope the company updates them and have them be available to those who have already purchased this chair.

Finally, my leaning lock mechanism doesn't lock the chair in place (This may just be me and I haven't contacted support yet so there may be a simple solution). However, the pros far outweigh the cons and I look forward to expanding my Autonomous products."

The number of ways you can adjust the chair is fantastic, never had a chair with as many options as this one. I had a ""gaming"" chair before this, and the difference between that and the ErgoChair Pro is night and day. I couldn't sit in my old chair for more than about an hour before I was uncomfortable, I can go 8 hours at a time in the ErgoChair and still be perfectly fine. At the full recline setting I can actually see myself being able to fall asleep in it.

Installation was a breeze also, and as soon as I was taking the parts out of the package I could tell that the build quality was superb. Putting it together took maybe 15-20 minutes, very simple to do. I will say the chair itself is decently heavy, so you might need help if you are moving it somewhere or up/down stairs, but that just shows that the build quality is very high.

5,2020-11-02T19:10:39Z,2-Nov,ErgoChair Pro - All Black,"TLDR - great chair for big &amp; tall person (6'2"", 270 lbs), recent lumbar fusion, 6-10 hrs per day usage. Only con is armrests. I bought this chair after much research. I had a double lumbar fusion a few months back and am a full-time student, so I NEEDED something that I could sit comfortably in for several hours per day. Every other chair that I looked at had something that I didn't like - not engineered for my size, bad design points, too expensive to not be the best option. Then I came across the ErgoChair Pro. I couldn't find anyone that had one to try it out, so I took a shot (again, after a lot of research). Shipping took a few weeks to leave the warehouse, and I had to contact customer service about that. But, they were very helpful (thanks Ashley!) and got it moving as quickly as you can expect during the COVID madness. Once it arrived, assembly took about 30 minutes, and figuring out all of the features took another 30 minutes of adjustments. But... Now I have a fantastic chair that suits me nearly perfectly. For my size, needs, and expectations, I do not think that I could have found a better chair, regardless of the price. I can work in this chair for hours on end without undue pain in my back or legs. It has a medium firmness seat cushion, cool mesh back and headrest, multiple adjustment points for getting that perfect posture, and reclines to about 135 degrees (not measured, but a guess). I am very happy with this purchase. The only cons I have are with the armrests. They have hard plastic supports and soft plastic rests - nothing fancy and I am not confident that they won't break one day when I accidentally put too much weight on them. In fact, they move (rotate inward and outward) every time I touch them, which gets annoying. They do have a bit of adjustability, but I still can't get the chair to fit under my desk (granted, its a weird corner L-shaped desk, but a little more downward adjustment and it would fit).

5,2020-11-02T10:35:55Z,2-Nov,You'll Be Pleasantly Surprised!,"For years, I&rsquo;ve been using cheap, low quality office chairs for my home office which has led to bad posture habits, along with severe back and neck pain. Even worse, I had come to resent my home work space simply because I could never sit for long periods without getting stiff and would lose focus which had eventually led to lack of productivity. I needed to do something about it regardless of how much it may cost, so I jumped online and did my research and came across the Autonomous Ergo Chair2. The sleekness and ergonomic feel of the chair drew me in so I began reading and watching the product reviews. There were some mixed opinions (be sure to watch product review videos yourself and form your own opinion), but overall I was intrigued by the number of adjustments available and the sheer strength of the chair so I made the purchase. First off, the customer service and timeliness was impeccable. I never spoke to a customer service representative since the online ordering process was seamless &ndash; from product selection to payment. Each step of the way I received email communication notifying me that my order was received, when it was shipped along with a tracking number, and confirmation that my order had been delivered. All of this took place over the course of four days! I placed my order on Thursday just after midnight and by 11 am on Sunday, my chair was at my front door. Now that&rsquo;s customer service in my opinion. Secondly, the assembly was fairly easy despite the multiple pieces required to put together. It took me about 30 minutes in total to assemble. The only thing that I would advise is to pay particular attention to the direction noted on the seat and place the armrests on the appropriate sides. If you&rsquo;re not paying attention, the armrests could end up facing backwards (I almost did this!) and you&rsquo;ll be delayed enjoying your new chair. The one thing I will note is that after placing my order, I did invest an additional $35 on Amazon and purchased universal fit rubber casters to replace the plastic ones that come with the chair. I&rsquo;m so glad I did, because they fit perfectly and the chair simply glides smoothly across the floor with almost no noise! I would highly recommend this. There are so many higher-priced options on the market that I&rsquo;m sure are great, but for the $369 price point, I don&rsquo;t think I could have made a better choice. The chair design itself is eye-catching, but really does align to the contours of your body in a seated position. I&rsquo;m a big guy (6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, 300lbs.) and work several hours a day from a seated position. The chair is low profile, but spacious enough to fit my bulky frame and allows for various movements and leg positioning to achieve comfort without digging into the back of my legs at the knees. The upright position forces you to have good posture without being uncomfortable, and the multiple adjustments allow you to maintain that posture and adjust your seated position for long-term comfort and fighting off fatigue. Having the ability to adjust the seat angle is also nice and allows you to stretch out your legs without getting up from the seated position, which is good for those long work sessions. The seat cushion is actually very comfortable despite what you may get from some of the product reviews. For me, it&rsquo;s the perfect balance between firm and cushy for my tooshie. The adjustable height of the chair allowed me to adjust perfectly to the height of my desk and I absolutely love the reclining feature and headrest. I&rsquo;m able to lay back and take a quick break, take a moment to think and analyze in complete comfort all the while being in complete balance without fear of tipping over.

As I sit on the seat I can just adjust my weight side to side and I feel the seat cushion part underneath rock back and forth too.... movement is only about a half inch, but I can feel it and wonder if this is going to wear down in the long haul. We'll see. Outside that tiny nudge, it's a perfect office chair."

By chance I looked around for a replacement chair in the meantime before I bought another high-end chair and found Autonomous. And oh man am I glad I did! I love everything about this chair and fulfilled all the requirements I was looking for with my past office chairs. An amazing adjustable back rest, lounge option, adjustable arm rests and even a very comfortable cushion which I prefer to most meshed equivalents. Don't let the price fool you, this is a juggernaut of a chair and I can see it lasting well into many future forays. I do have one gripe though, and that is the fact that the arm rest just crumples down when I put my weight on it to stand. I think this might come down to the manufacture's mistake or the fact that I should not put weight on it, but I find it unreasonably flimsy. There have been a couple of times already when It would falter and scare me half to death.

There are several different bolt lengths and the instructions never even once mentioned which bolts to use in which stage of assembly. I had to figure it out as I went.

5,2020-10-09T20:30:03Z,9-Oct,After several weeks,"I bought this chair after my employer bought these chairs for those who would be sitting for long periods of time (not including myself, a warehouse worker). I had the opportunity to steal a few minutes in the chair from time to time, but never prolonged periods. I read up some reviews before purchasing and noted that some people were unhappy with the cushioning on the seat. This, however, was a risk I was willing to take. After sitting in this chair for a variety of tasks of differing times, I'm inclined to agree with the uncomfortable cushioning. I believe this product would be much, much better with a comfortable and time-sustaining cushion. However, since I knew this going in, I had purchased material to place on my chair to negate this factor. For a chair this price though? Surely it couldn't hurt to put in a more comfortable material. I enjoy this chair and it's various features and adjustments. I bought it for ergonomic purposes, and it does a fantastic job.

I had the opportunity to steal a few minutes in the chair from time to time, but never prolonged periods. I read up some reviews before purchasing and noted that some people were unhappy with the cushioning on the seat. This, however, was a risk I was willing to take. After sitting in this chair for a variety of tasks of differing times, I'm inclined to agree with the uncomfortable cushioning. I believe this product would be much, much better with a comfortable and time-sustaining cushion. However, since I knew this going in, I had purchased material to place on my chair to negate this factor. For a chair this price though? Surely it couldn't hurt to put in a more comfortable material.

- Really like the back tilt adjustment

Cons 
- The seat tilt adjust only has two settings, flat and super tilted.  I am able to work with the flat adjustment, but if you need a versatile seat tilt adjustment you will probably need to spend money on a more expensive chair.
- A little smelly out of the box.  This went away after a few days.

It could definitely either be an inch or two thicker OR just be denser/firmer. I'm 170 lbs and 6ft tall and I wouldn't say that I am bottoming out by any means but I would appreciate more padding. That is the only thing that doesn't seem to be quite up to the quality of a Herman Miller chair. For such an important part of the chair I would think this would be an inexpensive no-brainer to perfect. Overall I am very pleased so far and would recommend this chair to anyone."

5,2020-05-21T09:06:58Z,21-May,Nice Little Chair,"Overall, the chair is awesome. There's a couple little things I don't like, but nothing major at all. The 1st is how I can't seem to lock the arm rest in place, so because they move left/right and forward/backward, it's easy to grab them and they'll move out of position. The 2nd is I can't seem to get the lumbar pressure to change even when I crank the handle like the instructions say. Not a huge deal, as I just lowered the lumbar and that's more comfortable. Now, the things I like! It's a sturdy chair. Like way more sturdy than I had imagined. This thing is kind of heavy. I love the back and headrest.

The 1st is how I can't seem to lock the arm rest in place, so because they move left/right and forward/backward, it's easy to grab them and they'll move out of position. The 2nd is I can't seem to get the lumbar pressure to change even when I crank the handle like the instructions say. Not a huge deal, as I just lowered the lumbar and that's more comfortable.

Aside from the medical benefits I gained from the chair the quality of these chairs are amazing. They're very well built with quality materials. Another bonus is the mesh back, it's not hot. The neck and lumbar support is awesome, but if there was one thing I would complain about is the back is a little too high, so the headrest won't fit as well even with it down as far as it'll go. Other than that, it was a positive purchase and I'm sure these will last many years."

The ErgoChair2 has been everything I expected and more. Super comfortable for long periods of time, as well as adjustable enough to move with my standing desk when I raise it some to get a different leg angle. Only took about 20 mins to assemble and all the tools are provided. One trick is when attaching the adjustment system to the chair bottom start with the bolt that goes through the cutout in the back lever (that way you can get the bolt into the hole with the rest of the mechanism loose). Would definitely recommend this chair to anyone.

Coming from an office with the leap to a home office, I needed a good chair.

I'm not much for a built in foot rest, but just being able to lower the seat a bit more would be nice. I'll probably build or buy a foot rest platform as it is, unless I can find some noticeably smaller casters that fit and still feel smooth.

I also did not expect the armrests to be adjustable side to side which was a very happy discovery for me, although the mechanism is a bit rough and doesn't move quite enough for me (to be fair, I like my armrests unusually close to my sides). 

Assembly was very easy, and the included bit driver was a nice touch.

5,2019-07-01T12:34:50Z,1-Jul,,"So I promised a review a few weeks ago but things got hectic due to the holidays, family visits, etc. So I am going to take the time to provide my review. I was going to do a video one, but I really don't know how to make videos like those fancy youtube ones: The initial setup of this office chair was honestly really easy. It was about 5 steps, took me around 10 minutes. Pretty standard for a regular chair. I am kind of glad I waited a few weeks because now I can give a very honest and thorough review. The second I started using it I felt like it was...different. This is because the chair I had for the past year was some cheap one I got on sale at Staples. I work from home so I spend literally half my life in the chair I use right now. Now, let me explain what I mean by different. My old chair was leather, which we all know will heat up like crazy after sitting on it for a long period of time. I would literally be peeling myself off the chair at the end of the day, sweat all over my back. So immediately I love the mesh backing of the ErgoChair. The bottom cushion is soft and quite cushiony. I've not had any problems at all with overheating on the tooshie either. Immediate a plus for me! Next, adjustments, adjustments, adjustments.

I was going to do a video one, but I really don't know how to make videos like those fancy youtube ones: The initial setup of this office chair was honestly really easy. It was about 5 steps, took me around 10 minutes. Pretty standard for a regular chair. I am kind of glad I waited a few weeks because now I can give a very honest and thorough review. The second I started using it I felt like it was...different. This is because the chair I had for the past year was some cheap one I got on sale at Staples. I work from home so I spend literally half my life in the chair I use right now. Now, let me explain what I mean by different. My old chair was leather, which we all know will heat up like crazy after sitting on it for a long period of time. I would literally be peeling myself off the chair at the end of the day, sweat all over my back. So immediately I love the mesh backing of the ErgoChair. The bottom cushion is soft and quite cushiony. I've not had any problems at all with overheating on the tooshie either. Immediate a plus for me! Next, adjustments, adjustments, adjustments.

IT WAS! I sit a lot for my work and wanted a better chair since I'm always slumping forward as I really get into my work. I figured I would spend some money on an item that gets used the most, other than my mouse and keyboard (which are already upgraded). The headrest and seat depth adjustment were a big deciding factor for me. Both are great! I'm 5'7"" and typically the seat depth is too deep on ALL other chairs. This causes me to rarely be seated far back enough for the chair back to support me properly. The ErgoChair Pro fits me! I haven't had furniture really fit me since I was in Japan (where my family is and short people rule!). The headrest is a wonderful feature that I've never experienced before. It definitely helps me be aware of my seating posture and feels good. I was a little skeptical about the back adjustments; namely the lumbar support. Other chairs I researched touted more adjustment to their lumbar support, like height AND how far it protrudes (depth). This chair only has height adjustment but it is now not a concern for me since it feels great! I watched NUMEROUS YouTube reviews and most of them complained about the armrests. They stated they don't lock in place when you move them around (they lock in their height only but not laterally, or forward and back), and they complained about how hard they were. Pffft, they feel fine. They are hard but not a problem (at least for me). There is the slightest give to them if you press with your thumb. They should support you and not perform like a seat cushion for arms; they don't need to be ""soft"". They are good and I like them. As far as the armrests not locking into place, I like that they don't! It makes adjusting them so effortless. YES, if you move your chair around by grabbing the armrests they WILL move out of the last position you put them in. That really doesn't matter since you simply sit back down and EASILY move them to whatever position you need them again. I can see the arguments of their lateral and forward/backward non-locking-ness but now that I'm using the chair it's something that I don't think I would want. They move easily and the armrest adjustment is something I'm using A LOT which is nice that their movement isn't encumbering me. They're good like this; it's a good design! The casters roll super smooth. The smoothest I've experienced. The seat cushion may be on the verge of too firm but time will tell. I could just be used to my previous chair which was too soft. The amount of adjustment on the chair is great. I like to tinker with stuff and all the levers are great to keep me occupied and making fine tuning adjustments. They're great.

We'll definitely be ordering more chairs!

The stool was on back order and was supposed to arrive in 5 weeks, but I think i got in within 2 if I'm not mistaken.  All products were packaged perfectly and arrived in great condition.  Each product came with basic, easy to understand instructions and all were put together within minutes.  I'd say the chair took a bit more, only because there were more screws, steps, etc... but all in all, if you can sharpen a pencil, you'll be fine with these.  

I have only used the products for a short while, but so far they are great.  The chair is very comfortable and suits my needs perfectly.  I also enjoy the many ways you can customize it.

The Ergostool is used by my wife and also really loves it.  I had my sister-in-law over the other weekend and she currently uses the balance ball or whatever chair.  She commented on the fact that she wished she knew about this one first.  (I also through out a pitch for the new DIY desk, so if she makes an order, I'll take 5% ;)  )  

The DIY desks are great as well.  The material is strong and put together well. The motor is heavy duty and is very quiet.  It is very easy to use.

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchases and will frequent their website for more furniture/supplies/etc... as my office grows.  Thank you Autonomous!

It's well made, doesn't squeak or rattle, has all the features one could ask for, looks great and is very comfortable. Of course, what is a review without offering a couple areas for improvement? :) The biggest gripe I have is with the armrests. No, they don't wobble and they are sturdy and basically comfortable, plus the ability to adjust the position forward and back and side to side is actually much more of a benefit than I expected. My problem with them is they don't go down far enough. I'm a fairly big guy (6'2"", 200 lbs) with long arms and even at the armrest's lowest setting, if I rest my elbows on them my shoulders end up hunched. Not a huge thing but I do wish they had included a spacer and longer screws so I could mount them a bit lower. Additionally, I wish the seat pad was replaceable. I understand this would be difficult from a design point of view, but like all seat padding, over time it will compress and become less ""cushion-y"". I've had mine for just over a year now and the padding under my tailbone is not what it once was. I have to say that I use the chair at least 10-12 hours a day, so I probably put more wear on it in a year than most people. Still, it would be nice to have the option. That being said, I would definitely purchase this chair again. In fact, I just did.

A couple of recommendations from a UX designer who can't help himself:

I immediately noticed some wear on the seat. It would be great if there were a replaceable cover.

I also think that the casters, which are pretty much the standard kind in office chairs, could be improved - maybe a polyurethane wheel instead? It would cut down on noise, make a smoother roll, and be less likely to scratch a wood floor.

Lastly, I'd love it if the neck support would move forward several more inches.

5,2018-09-05T00:00:00Z,5-Sep,Chair with Great Lumbar Support,"The product is an excellent quality basic office or desk chair that can be effectively utilized for your daily use. The delivery of the product was right on time, and it took me around 20 minutes to unbox the product completely. The assembly is fairly simple, and every component you require is already provided in the box. Do keep a screwdriver handy because the one that comes with the product was a bit small as per the size is concerned. Rest of the assembly is straightforward and simple. <br />The first time sitting experience was good. Though the ergonomic chair was stiff at first but gradually it felt very comfortable. The biggest feature for which I purchased this item was the dedicated lumbar support. This feature is very important for someone who has back pain problems like me.

5,2018-08-01T00:00:00Z,1-Aug,So Far So Great,"I've now had my ErgoChair Pro for about 3 weeks, and it is miles better than anything else I've used.  Loads of adjustments help you get a comfortable seating position, and let you move that position throughout the day so that your muscles don't get sore.  It seems really sturdy (I'm a big guy), with no creaks, no leaks from the pneumatic lift.  The mesh back and fabric cushion are very supportive and never cause excessive heat buildup or sweating (this was really put to the test when our office's A/C broke during the hottest week of August).

While I'm not going to take stars off my review, there are a couple of improvements I would suggest for the next iteration of ErgoChair.  
1) Add a little more padding to the seat.  Autonomous is one of the only companies to offer a fully-adjustable ergonomic chair with a higher weight capacity.  However, heavier people may find the seating surface a bit too firm.  It's not uncomfortable, but it's not exactly plush either.
2) Add a little more room for width adjustment on the arms.  I love that the armrests can slide in and out horizontally.  I'd like a little more range, though. 
3) Add depth adjustment to the headrest.  The fact that the ErgoChair2 came with a headrest was one of the main selling points for me over other ergonomic chairs.  My last chair was actually very comfortable, but didn't have a headrest so anything other than a completely vertical sitting position required me to strain my neck muscles.  The ErgoChair would be even better yet if you could adjust the headrest for depth as well as height.  As it is, you have to lean your head all the way back to use the headrest.  This is fine for more significant reclines, but for upright or slightly reclined positions, it would be nice to be able to make the headrest come to me instead of the other way around.",5,0,TRUE,FALSE,"So Far So Great: I've now had my ErgoChair Pro for about 3 weeks, and it is miles better than anything else I've used.

5,2018-07-29T13:30:04Z,29-Jul,,"Got my chair delivered today. As mentioned by another reviewer, double-boxed in heavy duty boxes. All contents packed carefully and cleanly. Instructions must have been improved because I did not notice either of the following issues from a very early review (badly translated instructions; no instructions regarding washer placement) Tool and parts packed and labeled clearly; instructions make it very clear which parts go where. One set of extra hardware also provided in case of loss (one of everything) No need for any other tools than what is provided in the package.
I'd say the unpacking and assembly was a pretty pleasant experience. Didn't get oil all over my hands from parts (just a bit from handling the washers). Didn't have to take apart and reassemble because of bad instructions. For me, the clean and secure packaging says a lot. You get a sense that the company cared enough to design the packaging so that the parts stay clean and are protected from damage. The parts do not look or feel cheap coming out of the box.
The chair is pretty comfortable. I've seen the complaints about armrests but I don't really share in that. They could be better but not a major issue for me. The seat cushion feels like it's on the soft side. It's OK for me but if you're a big person, i could see you bottoming out on the seat. 
The headrest is really awesome. All office chairs should have headrests.
Make sure to read the instructions so you hit all the adjustments available on the chair. Moving the seat forward did make a difference for me so try it out. Although it's not in the instructions, the lumbar support is also adjustable. You just give it a firm push up or down to move it vertically.
At work, I sit on a Herman Miller provided by the company (Setu chair; not quite as well known as the others) It's a very comfortable working chair. Autonomous is also comfortable but different. My office chair supports my entire back more firmly but not with dedicated lumbar support. If you're new to it like me, you probably have to play with the position to get it into a comfortable place for you. I'm pretty short (5' 8"") so the final adjustment ended up being at the bottom of the range. But the headrest really seals the deal for me. So nice to be able to sit back and relax for a few minutes with your head and neck fully supported. That is the only thing truly lacking on my Setu at the office.
As expected, there is a bit of new plastic smell. I'm pretty sensitive to these smells though. It's not enough to give up on sitting in it but I do notice it. It will go away soon enough.
For those of you who care, the chair does look nice. (I have the black/gray) It looks a lot nicer than anything you're likely to find at a local Office Depot or the like. If you're a reasonable person (and don't have any major physical ailments), I think you'd agree that you got a pretty good value for your money.

Pros:
The chair is very comfortable and has a lot of moving parts that allow you to make it fit your body!
- The lumbar support can move up and down which is very nice for helping me sit straighter.
- The head rest at first felt a little flimsy but once installed, it is sturdy, and is very comfortable as it supports my neck/head very well especially when you lean back.
- Just love how it can adjust to so many positions.
- Got the white/blue/grey colors and it looks great!
- Wheels roll smoothly
Cons
- The arm rests are a little hard
- It's a little difficult to move the lumbar support, and head rest up and down, and the bottom cushion forward/back.  Maybe after breaking it in a while it gets a little smoother, but at the same time the rigidity makes it feel more durable and reliable.

5,2018-02-06T20:51:45Z,6-Feb,,"I started investigating ergonomic office chairs a few months ago after suffering a lower back injury. I could tell that my current office chair was not helping matters as I spend maybe 6-8 hrs per day in front of my computer at work. 

Most ergo chairs, as you'll find, are priced anywhere from $200-1000+ and any with lumbar support and head rests are normally at the upper-end of that range. 

Autonomous were doing a pre-launch offer which was a total bargain, even with adding shipping on at about $40 within the US. At the launch price, I figured ""I might as well give it a shot"", so I pre-ordered the ErgoChair back in September or October and was given the usual ""Dec or Jan"" delivery. I have to admit, I had second thoughts approaching Christmas as I was traveling and did consider cancelling my order in that, for such a low price (launch deal of $179) perhaps the chair would not have particularly great build quality or live up to the 'ergo' claim. 

I arrived back in early January to find the ErgoChair box in my porch and began unpacking, ready for assembly. I have to say, the chair is heavy duty across the board which adds to the feeling of quality which is apparent upon first sight.

The instructions were pretty well put together and there's not an awful lot of assembly required, which is a good thing (i.e. the more manual assembly, the more room for error and for creating a rickety product).

If I had any complaints it'd be the arm rests. I haven't figured out yet how to make sure they are completely set (e.g. they slide from left to right) and they are the least well built component on the chair. 

The remainder of the build quality is excellent across the board. Comfortable mesh, supportive (fairly firm) seat, nice materials, a lovely, smooth and heavy-duty mechanism for the back support and genuinely helpful lumbar support and head rest. Also, it looks very cool. You'd normally expect to pay twice or three times the value of ErgoChair to get anywhere near the same level of quality, so I have to heavily recommend it on the value vs. quality ratio.

Now, when I go back to my old (standard) office chair it feels unsupportive and uncomfortable (even though it's softer and more cushioned). In that light, the ErgoChair is a resounding success of quality, support and value. Also, I can instantly feel it's much better for my back, comfort throughout the day and long-term use.

Definitely worth the value of $250. The only criticism which I can think of but is unfair, is that while the base is made of high quality materials, the arm rests and neck support plastic feels a bit on the lower quality side but it's $250, you have to cut corners somewhere to hit this price point.

Oh yea, the instructions are great, simple letter-coded tools to match the toolset and there are spares included in case you're clumsy like me.

Future product release request. I would love a built in leg rest. The reclining feature is so good that I wish my legs weren't just dangly.

I didn't feel that the lumbar support was adjustable nor deep enough, especially with how far forward the headrest pushed my head.  The cushion doesn't feel breathable and, at times, felt on the warm side of being comfortable, and this is while we're in the winter. I can't imagine how on fire my pants and my behind will be when the temperature rises. Also, I felt my coccyx was being into my body a bit more than I could handle, as if the rear portion of the cushion, rear the bulk of one's derriere would be placed, is a bit too stiff for my taste.

A number of adjustments don't feel as smooth as they could potentially be. Although stark and industrially cool to look at, the skeletal rear adjustment assembly may stick out a bit too far for some passerby's, giving your knees a delightful whack reminding me of impending arthroscopic treatments.
